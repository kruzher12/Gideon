800 years ago, 3000 dimensional gates opened across the entire world. In that moment, it was as if 3000 different colored eyes opened across the world as hordes of monsters swarmed out of these gates like tears.

Some could destroy city walls with one strike; They had bodies the size of a giant and fed on humans

Some latched onto humans, absorbing their bodies’ nutrients and enslaving humans

Some infiltrated the humans’ cities, disguising themselves as normal human beings while feeding upon human blood to sustain themselves.

In a night, the Human race fell to the bottom of the food chain.

The world had turned into a paradise for monsters…

From webnovel.com:

Chapter 1: What’s the Use of Looking Good!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation
Prologue:

Would You Like To Be A Dimensional-Traveler?

"I have finally gotten the nickname of the Ultimate African Chieftain! The only SSR card that I got was a Two-faced Buddha that accumulated from card pieces, I have never once gotten a Bird Sister or a Goldfinger before… I don’t want to play this game anymore!"

Lin Huang was expressionless. He had been playing Master XX for half a year, after obtaining tens of thousands of amulets, he had never gotten a SSR card; not even a SR card Bird Sister or a Goldfinger. He only managed to get those by accumulating card pieces so he did not have any hope for the 10 card draw. He had completely given up on the game since he got the nickname and began losing in battles.

He placed his finger on the game, took a deep breath and deleted the game. Just when he was about to keep his phone in his pocket, he felt a vibration. He then looked at the screen. It was completely black with a gold-colored sentence in the middle.

"Would you like to travel through dimensions?"

There was only one option at the bottom.

"Yes!"

It seemed like an online game commercial.

"Yes, my a*s!"

Since he had just deleted the Master XX game, Lin Huang did not have the mood to download any new games. He tapped on the home button on his phone. Just as he attempted to keep his phone in his pocket, his phone vibrated again. He took a look at his phone, it was the same page.

"Stop it! This mobile game is like some online game with endless pop-up commercials, who would want to play such game?" He frowned and closed the page. Just as he wanted to keep his phone, the same page popped up again.

"Could this be a virus?" Lin Huang frowned.

He was in love with his iFruit7 smartphone that he just bought. He spent one entire month's salary to get it after all. He restarted his phone and looked at the screen for a while. The page did not pop up again, he was relieved. When he picked up his phone, his phone vibrated and the page popped up again.

"Would you like to travel through dimensions?"

There was only one option at the bottom.

"Yes!"

"F*ck, this is not going away!" Lin Huang was furious.

"Since I’m getting it fixed later, I shall see this what kind of stupid game this is and I will report you!"

After some hesitation, Lin Huang pressed ‘yes’ on the screen. As he tapped 'yes', the screen began changing.

"Dear respectable dimensional-travel candidate, thank you for accepting our request. Please read the terms and conditions carefully. If you agree, please click ‘accept’ and you will officially be a dimensional-traveler. After obtaining your travel code, we'll send you a Goldfinger and transfer you to another world. Enjoy!"

The words appeared for about 20 seconds before the terms and conditions appeared.

"1. The current death rate of travelers are as high as 73%, please prepare yourself before traveling. Causes of deaths are as below:

Suicide - Death rate: 48%" 
Death through battle - Death rate: 33%" 
Natural death - Death rate: 10%" 
Assassinated - Death rate: 6%" 
Failed to activate Goldfinger - Death rate: 2%" 
Bad luck - Death rate: 1%"

…

Lin Huang only glanced at the first few pages as there were 118 pages to the terms and conditions. He was too lazy to read the entire thing so he scrolled to the bottom and clicked on the ‘accept’ button.

"Respectable candidate, you are now officially a dimensional-traveler. Your traveler code would be 142857. Entering Goldfinger page…"

The screen changed again, there was a spinner of 36 columns on the screen. Each column was the same size and there was a golden question mark on each of them with a pointer pointing in the 12 o’clock direction. There were two buttons at the bottom of the spinner, one was ‘start’ while the other was ‘stop’. There was also a description of the rules beneath the buttons.

"Press ‘start’ and the pointer will start to spin, press ‘stop’ to stop the pointer. The item that the pointer stops at will be your Goldfinger. If you did not press the ‘stop’ button, the pointer will stop automatically one minute after the spin had begun.

"Until now, they have yet to show me the name of the game. Let me know what game is this!" Lin Huang pressed ‘start’ and the spinner started spinning fast. A few moments, he pressed the ‘stop’ button. After gliding for a while, the pointer stopped at one of the question marks.

It then became a black card and the spinner disappeared. The card was enlarged and occupied the entire screen. Lin Huang raised his eyebrow, the card was nicely designed with metallic black and gold patterns on the edges.

"Not a bad card design…" Lin Huang complimented. However, as he thought of the Master XX game that he spent half a year playing, he became upset again as it was also a card game.

While he was immersed in his thoughts, a black glow shot out of his phone into his forehead. Lin Huang did not notice it at all as he looked at the screen of his phone that began changing.

"Goldfinger has been sent, now randomly picking an initial world for this travel…"

"Am I finally getting into the game?" Lin Huang smirked.

"As soon as I see the name of the game, I'll take a screenshot and report this stupid game!"

Soon, the screen on his phone changed again.

"The initial world that was randomly picked is ‘Monster Paradise’."

"Traveller 142857, enjoy your trip!"

"Pop!"

His gold iFruit7 phone dropped on the floor. The screen was destroyed, Lin Huang disappeared from where he was…

...

"Traveller’s Serial Number: 142857"

"Name: Lin Huang"

"Gender: Male"

"Age Before Traveling: 25 years old"

"Age After Travelling: 15 years old"

"Initial World: Monster Paradise"

"Travelling Identity Setting: Lin Huang, Male, 15. His 13-year-old sister is the only family member he has left in the world. Born with a broken Life Wheel, his lifespan is 10 times shorter than ordinary people."

"Remaining Lifespan: 91 days."

"Memory Integration: 98%"

"Number of Travels: 1"

"Goldfinger Status: Deactivated"

Looking at the semi-transparent page, Lin Huang was slightly startled. He could not recall how many times he had looked at that very page this week.

It had been a week since Lin Huang traveled to this world and became a 15-year-old juvenile. He was outstanding, bagging first place among the fresh graduates at the Hunter Reserve College where he obtained a full score for almost all his papers. However, he had one fatal setback - his broken Life Wheel.

There was a crack on the Life Wheel which looked like a gray stone in his body. It was almost broken in half. Among the 360 Life Light columns, only three were lit and the third one was quite dim.

To ordinary people, these columns would represent three years of life but as his lifespan loss was 10 times faster, Lin Huang was left with only three months to live.

"I look better now, perhaps the only thing I can be happy about." Lin Huang threw his head back as he laughed at himself in front of the mirror.

He had black, puffy short hair with eyes that were dark and intense. Lin Huang had nice features. Despite that, within a split second, he tightened his fists and frowned.

"What’s the use of looking good? Although the Goldfinger that you promised to give me before I began to travel is with me, at least send me a manual on how to use it. It has already been a week and I still have absolutely no idea on how I can activate Xiao Hei..."

Xiao Hei was the Goldfinger that Lin Huang randomly selected before he time traveled. It was a black card and he had tried every possible way he could to activate it but failed. He had no idea what the function of that card was.

"I’m back, brother!"

Just as Lin Huang pointed the mirror, playing the blame game, he heard the voice of a girl from behind the door. The door closed shortly after and he figured that the girl must have entered the password and entered the house.

He then shut the semi-transparent page before him and took stock of his emotions before walking down the stairs. He lived in a small double-storey penthouse where both bedrooms were on the second floor.

He arrived at the ground floor and smiled at the girl who was changing her shoes.

The girl seemed like a 13-year-old with short, black hair with a length slightly below her earlobes. Her bangs covered her eyebrows entirely and her eyes were bright and naive. She wore a printed white t-shirt, a pair of faded blue jeans and white sneakers. In all honesty, her clothing made her resemble a boy.

"Xin Er, you’re back! Wash your hands, we’re having dinner soon."

They sat across each other at the table. While they were eating, Lin Huang’s left pinky started to tingle. Soon, a semi-transparent video was projected in front of him. The same thing happened to Lin Xin! Her eyes popped when she saw her ring projecting a video.

The ring was given to everyone after they received their birth certificate. It contained information that included a personal identity account, and a small space for storage. It was also the only tool connected to the Heart Network. Projections like these were rare and if something like this ever happened, it usually meant something big had happened.

"Hmm?" Lin Huang stopped eating and stared at the projection. Lin Xin found it strange as well.

There was a middle-aged man with a serious expression in the video. Lin Huang recognized him, he was the news reporter from No.7 Safety Zone, quite the popular dude.

"Breaking news! Somebody found a new Virtual Eye 310 kilometers southeast from No.7D101. There’s a high possibility of a monster invasion. Those who reside in that area, please be aware. Do not leave the foothold, stay indoors tonight."

After watching the video, Lin Huang frowned as the area number, No.7D101 was the official code of Wulin Town, his home!

Based on the area size, Wulin Town was categorized into four grades A, B, C and D which respectively represented an area size that was large, medium, small and a core size, which was the smallest. The number 7 before the letter D was the safety code while number 101 at the back was the foothold’s code.

The Virtual Eye mentioned in the video was the portal that the monsters opened to invade the human world. It was named the Virtual Eye because it looked like a semi-transparent giant pupil that protruded towards the sky.

"Brother, the virtual eye is so near to our home, would monsters come into the foothold?" Lin Xin asked worriedly.

"Don’t worry about it. Now that the news is out, the Monster Hunters would’ve received the news as well. In fact, they’d get the news earlier than when we did. There’s also a defensive shield at the foothold which cannot be broken so easily." Lin Huang assured both him and Lin Xin and then exclaimed joyously, "Let’s eat!"

After dinner, Lin Xin went back to her room to get started on her homework while Lin Huang washed the dishes. The sky was getting darker. Lin Huang returned to his room and looked at the Heart Network’s page to check for updates regarding the Virtual Eye. On the Heart Network, ongoing news about the Virtual Eye was being broadcasted continuously after they received the alarming notification during their meals.

"The Monster Hunters have arrived at foothold No.7D101, close to the Virtual Eye to hunt down the monsters."

"Silver Hunter Li Lang appeared near foothold No.7D101!"

"Silver Hunter Li Lang led 18 hunters to hunt down the monsters."

"After more than an hour of hunting and killing, all monsters iron-level and above within 100 kilometers of No.7D101 were destroyed. More hunters joined the hunter troop to continue with the mission within that area."

…

Lin Huang was relieved when he read the news. He sounded so sure when he was comforting Lin Xin but in reality, he was not sure at all. After all, he had just arrived into this world for a month and it was his very first time encountering a Virtual Eye. But from what he read on the Heart Network, there were no threatening monsters from that Virtual Eye.

The time and location a Virtual Eye would open were completely random. The number and level of monsters cannot be predetermined. If the number or the level of monsters were too high, they would definitely be able to kill more than 10 hunters, including the Gold Hunters. The defensive shield in a small foothold like the Wulin Town would be insignificant, like paper glue when faced with a massive crowd of monsters. It would be hopeless and useless to try stopping those monsters then.

During Lin Huang’s first week since his arrival in this world, although he did not figure out how to activate his Goldfinger, he somehow figured out what kind of world he was in.

There were many history channels that spoke of monster attacks on the Heart Network. Lin Huang was taken aback the first time he saw it.

What he thought was unforgettable was the ruins of a huge foothold. He remembered each and every detail of the video recording.

A giant bloody pupil was opened in the void and countless monsters charged out of it. Within seconds, they broke through the defensive shield of the big foothold. That day, almost a billion people were killed by millions of monsters within a few hours.

The foothold was covered in blood with dead bodies floating on the sea of blood while monsters feasted on their remains…

The foothold that Lin Huang was located in was just a D-grade foothold. This small town had a small population of fewer than 100,000 people. Such a foothold was the least secured within the safety zone. If this foothold was attacked by a strong monster, everyone would perish even before any hunter could even arrive to rescue them. Fortunately, the opening of this Virtual Eye only released small monsters and hunters were able to kill them.

Lin Huang fell into deep thought after closing the Heart Network.

"From the speed of lifespan lost earlier, I’m only left with 91 days to live. The most important question right now was... How do I get the Life Crystals to replenish my Life Light? I have no idea how to activate Goldfinger so I best leave it aside. Life Crystals are up for purchase on the Heart Network but it’s too expensive. The minimum purchase, a year’s worth of Life Crystals costs 100,000 credit points. I don't even have 30,000 in savings!"

Life Crystals were a unique item that barely dropped from hunting monsters. There is a massive amount of Life Light in each crystal. It must be chewed in the mouths and the Life Light in the crystals will then enter the Life Wheel.

"The fastest way to get Life Crystals is by hunting monsters and selling the materials on the monsters’ bodies. It’s certainty that there would be Life Crystals achievable from the hunt. However, with my ability now which isn’t even at iron-level, the kind of monsters I’m able to fight are worthless… Worry not for I shall try my luck outside of the foothold. Perhaps there would be at least one Life Crystal. I shall get ready tomorrow and head out the day after!"

It was late at night; Lin Huang stared at the dark sky from his window. After a short while, he emptied his mind and went to bed.

In the middle of the night, a noise that sounded like glass breaking woke him up.

"Ahh…!!"

Just as Lin Huang woke up, he heard a girl scream in his blurred state. The scream came from close by and he could tell; it was his sister, Lin Xin’s voice.

He jumped down of his bed and dashed to Lin Xin’s room. He did not even have the time to change; he was still in his pajamas.

He flung the door open.

Chapter 2: Vampire

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation
Lin Huang felt his heart beat faster and faster as he entered Lin Xin’s room.

The light in her room was switched on and he saw a young, muscular man halfway into her room. He must have crept in from the broken window. He held Lin Xin’s foot and a blurred sound echoed from his mouth.

Lin Xin quickly hid behind the head of her bed, her feet was just a few centimeters from that scary being.

She was horrified! She cried and her body was shivering. She was too frightened to even think of running away.

Lin Huang then looked up to the man. He had red hair, his chin and clothes were covered in blood.

What caught Lin Huang’s attention was his eyes, it was bloody red. Lin Huang was numb, for a second, he thought that the man could just be a vampire.

He looked around Lin Xin’s room and noticed her school bag at the left side of the door. Fearful, he flung the school bag at the ‘man’s direction.

The vampire’s senses were quick to act, he immediately grabbed it, tore it apart.

In that short distraction, Lin Huang ran to the bed, carried Lin Xin and sprinted out of the room. Just when they thought they were safe, Lin Xin screamed to the top of her lungs. Lin Huang turned around to see the vampire’s vein-bulging arm on Lin Xin’s left foot.

"Close your eyes!", Lin Huang instructed.

Lin Xin immediately did as she was told. Lin Huang saw a lamp near the bed, picked it up and smashed the vampire’s arm with full force.

The light bulb of the lamp was made of white light stone which will release high temperature light if broken. It was a cheap but extremely dangerous. The rich would never trust such a lamp but now, it was indeed a life-saver.

The light bulb of the lamp broke once it hit the vampire’s arm and a strong white light filled the room. The broken white light stone released an unbearable heat that caused the vampire to groan and let go of Lin Xin’s foot.

　　

Lin Huang closed his eyes as he took his last few steps and when he opened his eyes, he was already at the door. He did not waste any time, worried that the vampire’s vision would recover, Lin Huang ran down the stairs, panting.

As he ran, he remembered reading from a fairy tale book that vampy’s hated lights because it burned their eyes. Vampires are nocturnal creatures, born to hunt in the dark and avoided places with lights and this was precisely why the vampire refrained from entering Lin Xin’s room earlier.

From the ground floor, sounds of glass breaking came from upstairs. It was almost as if the hanging lights in Lin Xin’s room fell.

"Hide in the bathroom and lock the door!" Lin Huang ordered Lin Xin at once.

"Wh-what how about you?" Lin Xin asked her brother, her tone shaky.

"I can handle him, have you forgotten that I graduated on top of my class from Hunter Reserve College? It would be a distraction if you stayed here with me." Lin Huang explained lovingly to his sister.

Lin Xin nodded and did as she was told. She had faith in her brother.

Lin Huang had an action plan. He first sent out a distress signal to the Heart Network and then he ran to the kitchen to grab a knife.

The lowest level of a vampire was at least an iron-level. Besides possessing 10 times the strength of an adult, with their blood power, they were much stronger than an iron-level monster.

Anyone who encountered iron-level monsters may not walk away alive, hunters from Hunter Reserve College included. Therefore, what Lin Huang had told his sister was merely to comfort her as he knew that there was a probability he could lose to this vampire.

He thought, however, that it was strange that his head was clear when he was faced with the monster earlier although he was in so much fear and anxiety. In that moment, whatever he had read about vampires flashed in his mind.

Vampires were human-like monsters – they blend in with the human lifestyles during the day but their desire for blood arose at nights.

Their food - human blood and the blood of young girls’ blood were especially delicious, their favorite. They smell blood up to a few hundred kilometers away.

Even for an iron-level vampire, as soon their blood power is activated, their strength, speed, and defense would amplify themselves. Their bodies would be covered with an energy layer that formed from the gathered blood power. The energy layer could even turn into wings, tails, claws and other weapons which multiplied their effectiveness.

Vampires may hate the exposure of bright lights but it does not weaken them. Their one weakness was a substance called septic divisor that could only be extracted from a rare plant.

In reality, the septic divisor was poisonous to most organisms with flesh, included us humans. As soon as it contaminated a wound, it would penetrate into the organism’s blood circulatory system and kill red blood cells. It was sold at pharmacies and some hunters used them to soak their weapons.

The septic divisor had the perfect repression effect on vampires as it would cut open the blood layer on their body if they touched a weapon soaked in septic divisor. The would cause the vampire’s body to rot and without an antidote, it would melt to the ground within three hours.

However, the septic divisor was not cheap. Even a licensed hunter would think twice before using it generously – only in times of emergency.

Lin Huang’s savings was not enough for him to buy one.

While he was struggling with his thoughts, his ring began vibrating again.

"I am hunter Li Lang, I assume you asked for help to be sent. What happened?" A matured but young voice sounded from the rescue line across him.

"My home is being attacked by a vampire…" just as Lin Huang finished his sentence, he heard a loud thud. Then, a shadow leaped from the second floor and appeared not far away from him.

"I’ve set the location on my ring, please hurry!" With that, he hung up the phone.

He needed to focus on defeating a 10-time-stronger enemy standing in front of his face.

"Bang… Bang… Bang…"

Heavy footsteps walked towards him and he could barely make out the being in front of him due to the dust in the air. When it disappeared, he starred right into the vampire’s red eyes which was also targeting him.

Lin Huang felt a rush of goosebumps.

In a split second, the vampire’s focus shifted to the direction of the bathroom. He could smell the odor of the prey that he was hunting. The prey was just behind the door, it was a delicious and irresistible fragrant to him. He was drooling, all the way from his chin to the floor.

The vampire immediately ran in the direction of the bathroom, ignoring Lin Huang.

Lin Huang mustered his courage and yelled "Hey, did you forget something?" at the vampire while he tossed the knife onto the vampire’s body!

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3: Goldfinger Has Been Activated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation
This vampire's senses were amazing. He could sense the knife flying in his direction and so dodged it in time. Almost instantaneously, the knife pierced into the wall, its blade still vibrating.

The vampire stopped walking and stared at Lin Huang. While Lin Huang was relieved that the vampire did not charge at him, he gulped while mumbling to himself, "Let's get this over and done with!"

He tossed out the second knife he had with him at the vampire because he was worried that the vampire would ignore him but attack Lin Xin. Therefore, he chose the classic tactic to infuriate and distract the enemy.

As expected, it worked. The vampire was furious, he smacked the knife away again. Blood was dripping from the crown of his head to his feet and soon completely covered his body.

Lin Huang was breathing heavily. It was his first time encountering a vampire that used Blood Power and he was under intense stress. A vampire that used Blood Power was completely beyond human; it was considered a real monster.

What Lin Huang saw later made his heart skip a beat…

There was a pair of blood-colored energy supply that looked like wings growing out of his back.

They were around two meters long each.

"Oh no! This monster is not iron-leveled, but bronze-leveled!"

Lin Huang remembered clearly that an iron-level vampire could only have one energy supply while those on bronze-level could grow two energy supplies.

Lin Huang's face turned pale; he did not know that it was a bronze-level vampire that invaded his home. As compared to a bronze-level, he was more than 100 times weaker than the vampire.

"That's not right. If this vampire is bronze-level, he wouldn't be harmed by the broken white light stone to the extent he would let his prey go." Lin Huang recalled when he hit the vampire with the lamp earlier; the vampire lets go of Lin Xin due to the burning heat.

He took a closer look at the vampire, and soon he noticed there were two obvious wounds on him. One was on his right shoulder where it was so deep that his bone was exposed while another one was on his left chest where the knife pierced through, almost two centimeters away from his heart.

The wounds started to rot; it seemed that the cut happened earlier than an hour ago. The wounds were not initially noticeable because the vampire's body was out of the window and he was filled with blood. Now that he saw them clearly, he understood why this bronze-level vampire had the strength that was weaker than an iron-level.

"He looks extremely weak now and it looks like even his heart was contaminated with septic divisor and he might not live for more than three hours. No wonder his strength regressed. As long as I stay a distance away from him and try my best to avoid the attack from his Blood Power, I should be safe!"

Now that he was clear about how severely hurt the vampire was, Lin Huang's fear was gone. He had one thought on his mind - to drag the vampire to his death!

The vampire gave Lin Huang a deadly stare, the wings on his back got longer and turned into two sharp cones charging his way.

Lin Huang had expected that to happen. He took a few steps to his right and dived onto the dining table, few meters away.

The first hit was a miss. His wings became long canes and he turned towards Lin Huang. The cupboard and chairs in the way were crushed.

If the hit were to fall on Lin Huang, even if he did not die, his boned would have been crushed too.

Lin Huang jumped and with one hand supported on the second floor, he managed to cross the railings and onto the second floor.

The vampire's second hit smashed the dining table and the pieces were spread onto the ground.

Lin Huang stood, frozen on the second floor as he was worried that the vampire would go for Lin Xin instead. He picked up a porcelain vase and threw at the vampire.

He heard a "Bang". The vase crushed the vampire's wings and the vampire roared in pain in Lin Huang's direction.

There was a limit to the strength and extension of his wings. The vampire noticed that he could not reach Lin Huang anymore, so he jumped to the second floor where Lin Huang was standing.

Lin Huang immediately fled and hid under his bed.

There, he found a wooden box that was one foot long. He opened the box and took out a silver pistol.

It was a Gray Eagle17, the latest pistol from the Eagle Company. Its power was impeccable; it was nothing less than an iron-level firearm.

With Lin Huang's financial situation, it was impossible that he could afford such weapon.

It was a reward for getting number one in his college education.

Lin Huang took out the pistol and put the two remaining cartridges into his left pocket. He then opened the safety catch. Just when he aimed his pistol at the door, the vampire barged in.

"Bang!"

A fire was shot from under the bed and the vampire groaned with anger.

The shot may not have hurt him but as he was caught off guard but that gunshot did dim the Blood Power layer on the vampire.

"Bang! Bang!" Another two shots were fired.

The vampire's Blood Power layer dimmed even more. He flipped his giant wings in anger and plunged towards the bed.

Lin Huang was prepared for that. He kicked the wall hard and got out under the bed. He then ran to the balcony and jumped over the railing.

The vampire was furious. He chased after Lin Huang.

Street101 was under his balcony, one of the main streets on the foothold. There were street lights with moonlight stones shining on the ground.

The vampire could not find Lin Huang as the streetlights were not that bright.

Lin Huang outsmarted the vampire! He had only pretended to jump but did not do so. He used his fingers to hang himself on the balcony floor and when the vampire had jumped off the balcony, he climbed back up.

Lin Huang stared at the vampire and aimed his pistol at the vampire's head.

"Bang! Bang! Bang…"

In the midst of the shots and the roars of the vampire, the lights in the houses on the streets went off. There was pin drop silence. Only the noise from the gunshots and the vampire's roars echoed on the streets.

He could see the vampire with the street lights and he could also see the Blood Power layer thinning and the vampire's wings contracted back in.

The vampire finally stumbled away in excruciating pain.

Lin Huang did not bother running after the vampire but instead opened fire and shot 20 times.

Seeing as the vampire was not far off, about approximately 200 meters away and so he reloaded a new cartridge, jumped to the ground floor and ran after the vampire.

It started off as a quiet night but sounds of gunshots and vampire groans soon filled that silence.

The vampire's Blood Power layer got thinner when the bullets penetrated through his outer-defense layer and straight to his inner body.

Lin Huang was cautious to keep his distance from the vampire.

With every trigger pulled, Lin Huang felt like a trained hunter.

Bullets were hitting on the vampire's Blood Power layer and soon, it became semi-transparent. At the 18th bullet fired, the vampire's Blood Power layer disappeared entirely.

Lin Huang grinned. He fired his last two bullets at the vampire's wound, targeting at its left chest. He then reloaded the last cartridge and when he was ready to shoot, the vampire fell to the ground. The vampire attempted to get up but he seemed out of breath and badly injured. He crawled forward.

Lin Huang did not open fire but he sprinted to the vampire and stopped 15 meters away as he had calculated before, the vampire could only stretch his wings for less than 10 meters and therefore, 15 meters would be a safe distance.

Lin Huang carefully pointed his pistol at the back of the vampire's head and fired two shots. He was relieved when the vampire's head cracked and brain juice oozed onto the road.

"Ding!"

A notification came into Lin Huang's ears. Soon, a semi-transparent page appeared before him with messages:

"Goldfinger has been activated!"

"Host completed his first kill; one Monster Card is rewarded!"

"Host completed rank-crossing kill; one Advance Card is rewarded!"

"Host completed double rank-crossing kill, one Random Card draw is rewarded!"

…

"Setting of Host's Exclusive Card"

"Host: Lin Huang"

"Gender: Male"

"Age: 15."

"Combat Strength: None (Exceeded assessment limit)

"Skill: None (Mastered basic skills - beyond range of assessment)"

"Summon Authority: Activated"

"Available Number of Summons: 1."

"Remark: You’re so weak!"

Lin Huang had a strange expression on his face, "The Goldfinger has been activated, but what do these remarks mean?!"

Chapter 1: Reborn in Another World

Translator: - -  Editor: - -
Shi Yan woke up with a start. His head was throbbing in pain, as if it was filled with lead and it felt extremely heavy.

Once the pain faded decreased slightly, he found himself in a dimly lit stone cave which was the size of a basketball court. Piles of bones were scattered all over the place, and a dozen corpses covered in strange clothes lay beside him. The clothes looked new and bright. As if these people had died recently.

"Where is this? Is this still the Bahamas?"

Shi Yan, 27 years old, was an insane fanatic of extreme sports. His mother died early, while his father died of cancer in the prime of his life. But, he had saved a fortune working his whole life. This left him with such a large amount of wealth which he could never use in a lifetime.

He owned many things at an early age, which other people would pursue their entire life.

Although young and rich, he had no future goals, which made him unhappy for a long time.

At the age of 17, he had his first taste of extreme sports, which brought him unspeakable excitement. Given his large amount of wealth, he could undertake these sports as much as he liked, which ordinary people would not be able to afford this.

Traditional extreme sports, such as free-climbing, crocodile bungee, low-altitude parachuting, volcanic skateboarding, cliff diving and limbo skating, brought him the greatest enjoyment and pleasure.

The thrill of being on the verge of death invigorated him and made his blood boil.

In ten years, he had tried all sorts of the most dangerous extreme sports due to which his body was extraordinarily strong. Hundreds of near-death experiences made his nerves as hard as steel. He once joked that he was the man who was closest to the Grim Reaper.

The blue-hole exploration in the Bahamas was his most dangerous extreme sports trip. Some of these blue-holes were hundreds of meters deep, while some were complex like mazes. What's more, every little move could stir the sand up on the bottom of the cave. No matter how bright your light was, you wouldn't be able to see anything in front of you.

Even if you were an experienced diver, you had to wear a steel wire before you jumped into a blue-hole. The steel wire was the lifeline of explorers, and its length decided the distance explorers could go. Moving beyond that distance was tantamount to suicide because nobody ever got out of that maze without a steel wire. According to the statistics from the Bahamas Maritime Institute, there was an average of 20 cave diving related deaths in the blue-hole, most of whom died from losing direction.

In this dangerous extreme adventure, Shi Yan threw away his lifeline; the steel wire, entering into a suicidal adventure, and finally lost himself in the mysterious blue-hole.

And in the blue-hole, getting lost meant certain death.

---

Shi Yan lay collapsed on the ice-cold rock ground, looking at his surroundings with the aid of a dim light coming from the cave walls. In his mind, there appeared some memory fragments that didn't belong to him.

This was the memory of another Shi Yan...

That boy was 17 years old and had the same name as himself. He was attracted to antiques and was obsessed with all kinds of historical remains; because of an ancient map, he strived for half a year and eventually got here with his guards.

Feeling weak all over, Shi Yan frowned and slowly lifted himself up.

Just then, to his surprise, Shi Yan noticed that this body was not his own, but that of the other Shi Yan who was only 17 years old.

He was dumbstruck for a moment.

"Didn't I die in the blue-hole? No! I am still alive, but in an unbelievable way!"

...

According to the other Shi Yan's memory, this place was called Grace Mainland, where there was no science or technology. There were endless waging wars and warriors raging everywhere!

Many dwellers here showed mysterious abilities not long after they were born. Some had the power of lightning, some could control plants, some could tunnel into the earth, some could use the chill of frost, and some were capable of communicating with demon beasts...

People with these various abilities would all become warriors, and their abilities were referred to as Martial Spirits.

Martial Spirits were nearly all possessed at birth, and only very few could acquire a spirit through some stroke of luck. That is why this mainland was named Grace Mainland, as the warriors believed that Martial Spirits were God gifted.

Not every warrior could possess a "Martial Spirit", in fact, the majority of warriors weren't blessed with one. Ordinary people could train hard to become a warrior, but there was no way to obtain a Martial Spirit through training. Martial Spirits were so powerful that they could benefit a warrior's training, increasing their combat potential significantly and granting them their own special abilities...

As a result, among warriors of the same level, those who owned a Martial Spirit tended to be much stronger and achieved significantly greater results. They did half the work with double the results.

The "Martial Spirit" can be inherited through blood, plus there was a higher probability where one inherited the Martial Spirit.

In general, if one of the parents possessed a spirit, there was a high possibility that their child would inherit the same spirit. If both of the parents had a spirit, their child would have an even greater chance to inherit one of their spirits, either from the father or the mother.

There was only a one in a hundred chance that a couple, who both possessed a martial spirit, would give birth to an ordinary child.

Even rarer was the situation where the kid inherited both spirits from his parents. This inherent type of Martial Spirit was called "Twin Spirits", and those type of lucky individuals which possessed them were also known as a 'Son of God'! It only happened to one in ten thousand couples who possessed different Spirits.

Shi Yan stood there and continued to put the fragmented memories in order.

The original owner of this body came from the Shi Family. They possessed the Petrification Martial Spirit which could make the body as hard as a rock in battle, preventing damage to the body. As said fighter raised their cultivation, the Petrification Martial Spirit would become much stronger, to the point where they were almost indestructible.

Unfortunately, this guy didn't inherit the Petrification Martial Spirit and was thus considered a poor successor for the martial arts that the Shi Family trained in. He also showed no interest in martial arts, and never learned anything about them either. All he had been devoted to was the exploration of historical remains.

Thanks to that ancient map, he had crawled through numerous heavy bushes and suffered a lot to arrive at this ancient cave.

"Wu wu wu.... hu hu hu.... "

Suddenly, a devil-like cry came from deep within the cave. Astonished, Shi Yan looked around only to find a blood pool in the direction the voice came from.

The blood pool, about 10 square meters in size, was located in the middle of the cave, filled with a red fluid which looked just like blood. It was bubbling on the surface and was giving out horrifying shrieks and howls when the bubbles popped.

He realized that his escorts were driven insane by the howls, and they had started to kill each other. They all died in succession, while the 17-year-old Shi Yan fainted from the frightening shrieks.

It was all because of the blood pool!

Shi Yan stared at the blood pool with a rigid face. The howls slowly evoked the desire to kill within him, and made him want to kill anyone around him!

His head was still aching and the howls from the blood pool never stopped tormenting him, which made it harder for him to concentrate.

"...Must be the blood pool!"

With a grim expression, he tried to guard his mind. His countless near-death experiences had steeled his mind and Shi Yan managed to calm down. Although his head still ached, he was able to stay focused and walked towards the blood pool.

"Crack, crack, crack!"

Shi Yan looked dignified, as he walked gray dry bones shattered under his feet. Judging by the pile of bones in the cave, he could only guess how many people had previously died in this place. The pool was the source of this evil. If he wanted to examine the secrets of the blood pool, he had to be prepared for death.

As he got closer to the blood pool, the howls kept getting louder and louder which drilled into his head like sharp knives. The sound of slaughter contained in the howls almost destroyed his reasoning. He wouldn't have been able to bear this pain if it weren't for the extreme conditions he faced for so many years that had slowly formed his spirit.

A heap of bones was situated beside the blood pool; some milky white bones also floated in the center of the pool. This small blood pool was like a sea of blood from hell, which had devoured an uncountable number of lives.

Shi Yan had a feeling that his soul was summoned here because of this bizarre blood pool. He thought maybe this blood pool was his ticket back to the Earth.

When he got closer to the blood pool, Shi Yan suddenly found something strange. The blood in the middle of the pool was scarlet and thick, but he couldn't detect the slightest whiff of the scent of blood.

On the contrary, the air around him was very fresh, even filled with an unexplainable fragrance. After careful inspection, he determined that the exotic fragrance actually came from the blood pool!

Shi Yan was full of curiosity and thought that there must be something weird in the blood pool.

Again, he took a few steps forward. All of a sudden, an illusion of an endless sea, filled with scarlet red blood entered his mind. Pile of corpses like a small island were there. Some of the bones were like those of the cretaceous period dinosaurs and were as large as a small hill. There was a repeatedly screaming sound coming out from the blood sea, "Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!"

Shi Yan tried to stay calm, but he couldn't. His heart started to beat faster and faster. A suffocating and terrifying pressure overwhelmed him. He felt a familiar feeling like those near death experiences he experienced back on Earth

He knew that the next step likely meant death!

However, those dreary adventures over the years hadn't terrified him, but instead had given him the utmost pleasure! Being face to face with death and surviving all perils was the true definition of extreme sports!

Step by step, one after the other!

Under the calling of the blood pool, Shi Yan finally went up to the edge. He stared at the small blood pool; the insane side of his character had been triggered. He roared, "Let's see what you have to offer, small little blood pool!"

Then, he jumped into the pool.

Chapter 2: The Body Remodelled

Translator: - -  Editor: - -
A sudden change occurred in the blood pool!

As Shi Yan stood in the middle of the blood pool, the blood was already up to his waist. However, the blood in the pool started to move around as if it was alive, creeping up and down his body like vines. Seconds later, his whole body was tightly bound and covered with blood.

The crimson blood in the pool was like vicious snakes, untiringly wrapping around him until it formed a bloody cocoon.

A wave of intense pain spread throughout his body. Shi Yan felt as if his brain was being sliced into pieces. It felt even worse than death. It was as if tens of millions of tiny worms were drilling into his body and squirming around in his arms, legs, bones, and viscera; eating away his blood and flesh.

Shi Yan couldn't see anything. He wanted to scream, but couldn't make a sound, and neither could his body move.

A strange liquid started flowing slowly along his ribs like a small stream and tore open his veins wherever it passed. Then the liquid rapidly accelerated and separated into many strands, madly surging into the seven hundred and twenty meridians within his body.

He felt that his seven hundred and twenty meridians had enlarged significantly, as they interchanged between feeling scorching hot and biting cold. It felt extremely uncomfortable.

The pain in his head grew stronger, in his dazed state, Shi Yan felt some weird changes happening within his meridians[1]. Soon after, his meridians turned into, madly, swirling little cyclones.

A small amount of the bright red liquid infused itself into every cyclone and was swiftly absorbed into them. After absorbing the liquid, the cyclones enlarged and the process sped up.

It may be because of the intensity of the pain that was almost unbearable, in his dizzying state, Shi Yan felt that his body was like a huge vessel, filled with the strange liquid. It was transforming him in ways he couldn't possibly imagine.

Specifically, they were changing the seven hundred and twenty meridians in his body!

As this thought flashed through his mind, he fainted.

---

After a long time, Shi Yan awoke again.

The searing pain had disappeared replaced by a numb pain in his meridians. The liquid had returned to its origin and blood pool was tranquil.

Unexpectedly, he felt a warm sensation swirling through his body. After this sensation made a complete cycle, he felt extraordinary comfortable and his body had increased in strength.

Profound Qi! [2]

It dawned on him the blood pool finally brought him some benefits! The thing flowing through his meridians was clearly the Profound Qi which only warriors could obtain!

Within the memory of the other Shi Yan, he came to know that Profound Qi was the source of power for warriors. It was the foundation for warriors to support and release powerful martial arts.

Warriors were ranked into ten realms, according to the strength of their Profound Qi. These were Elementary, Nascent, Human, Disaster, Earth, Nirvana, Sky, Spirit God, True God and King God[3], with each realm containing three "sky" levels.

Warriors were the most powerful individuals in this world. Profound Qi determines the status one would have. One could be a warrior as long as he had the slightest amount of Profound Qi.

Most people couldn't get Profound Qi throughout their entire life. Once obtained, they could strengthen it simply by training. Therefore, as long as a warrior possessed Qi, they would always have their own place in this world.

As the weak Profound Qi gently circulated throughout his body, Shi Yan came to his senses. Even if he couldn't go back to his world, he wouldn't starve to death here. Just then he noticed that the blood cocoon was still tightly wrapped around him.

Shi Yan spared no effort to struggle.

"Crack!"

A big slit cracked open on the blood cocoon, and Shi Yan jumped out. Looking around, he found himself in that odd cave with bones everywhere.

However, the blood pool had all dried up!

In the dried-up blood pool, only a few pieces of broken bones were left, the bright red thick pool of blood had disappeared without a trace.

A huge glittering blood cocoon, as thin as a wafer, towered in the center of the empty pool. However, after Shi Yan only glanced at it, a small flame ignited at the bottom of the cocoon. The flame grew wildly and started to burn the bones. In a few minutes, the blood cocoon and the bones were all burned to nothingness.

A red light sparkled in the dry pool. An old ring with intricate blood vein designs quietly lying there.

Shi Yan stared at the strange ring and assumed this ring was somehow connected with the blood pool. After a few seconds of hesitation, he stepped in again, picked up the ring, and wore it on the ring finger of his left hand.

The ring carried a warmth that made Shi Yan feel strongly connected to it as if the ring had become a part of his body. All at once, the weak Profound Qi in his body lost control and rushed towards the crimson ring. However, his skin blocked it and it failed to enter the ring.

Shi Yan was shocked and tried to take off the ring immediately, only to find the ring had been firmly stuck onto his ring finger like an unmovable boulder. No matter how hard he tried, the ring wouldn't move an inch.

Now that the Profound Qi couldn't break the skin, it went back to normal after a while. The warmth and the red gleam on the ring faded away as well.

Shaking the ring around for a moment, he realized that there was no longer anything unusual with it, thus Shi Yan started to analyze the situation.

Soon, Shi Yan concluded that all the blood in the pool went into his body!

The blood pool was ten square meters in size. Though not huge, the blood it contained would weigh at least a few tons. Even an elephant couldn't hold that much liquid inside its body!

Shi Yan turned pale. He subconsciously looked around and wanted to see how his body had changed. Had it swelled up?

When he looked, Shi Yan was startled again!

Surprisingly, he body became skinnier than before like it was only skin and bones! The clothes on him that had fit before looked ridiculously large now. Rather than calling him skinny, it was better to call him a withered mummy.

Shi Yan turned even paler. He never expected that this blood pool would not only fail to send him back to his previous world but would make such unthinkable changes to him.

"Guru~ Guru~!!"

His stomach began rumbling and he suddenly felt ravenous. He thought he could almost devour an elephant.

But, the cave had nothing edible. He glanced at the dry blood pool and was sad to find that he could no longer return to his world.

Shi Yan decided to find a weapon. He remembered his escorts had fought one another with all kinds of weapons. However, after examining them, he found them either rusted or destroyed, not useful to him anymore.

Disappointed, Shi Yan could only leave empty-handed from the stone cave.

---

The moist air was warm and carried with it the sound of water running in the distance. Ancient trees blocked the sun like a giant umbrella. Only a few spots of sunlight could be seen on the wetland.

The Dark Forest! Shi Yan recalled this place with the help of the memory of his new body once he got out of the cave.

The Dark Forest covered a large area, where the trees were too thick to let the sunlight in. the reason why it was called the Dark Forest was cos it was damp and dark even in the daytime.

The Dark Forest was surrounded by the Merchant Union, the Fire Empire and the God-blessed Empire[4]. The Merchant Union was to the north of the forest, the God-blessed Empire in the south, and the Fire Empire in the west. Merchants from the three countries had to pass through the Dark Forest to trade.

Demon beasts always made their appearance in the Dark Forest, some of which even reached the 6th or 7th level. As the trade caravans, soldiers, and warriors crossed the Dark Forest now and then, they knew that high-level demon beasts only appear in special areas, and low-level ones were usually vagrants.

In general, trade caravans wouldn't come across high-level demon beasts as long as they traveled along their usual routes. Only soldiers and warriors, who often ventured into the beast-infested areas looking for fights, would easily come face to face with high-level demon beasts, and eventually suffered great losses.

Great risk yields great benefits. Once a soldier killed a demon beast of the 6th or 7th level, he would immediately obtain many crystal coins. Demon Beast above level 6 each had a monster core inside its body. This monster core was of great use to warriors, alchemists, and blacksmiths.

Apart from the monster core, its fur, fangs, bones, flesh, and poison were all very valuable. The body of a high-grade demon beast was full of treasures.

This attracted bold soldiers and warriors to venture into the Dark Forest. However, only a few people achieved their goals and gain some benefits. The majority of them underestimated the wisdom and strength of a demon beast and thus, paid for it with their lives.

Shi Yan observed his surroundings for a while and heard the sound of water in the distance, combined with the sound of women talking.

As Shi Yan was hesitating, he noticed a slight rustling sound from the bushes not far away, as if someone was fiddling with the leaves.

Shi Yan subconsciously looked towards that direction.

Through the thick bushes, he saw a slim and graceful female body. The woman took off her white belt, squatted down, and showed her peach-shaped white bottom to him. Her snow-white hand was waving off annoying mosquitoes, as she was about to urinate...

The woman apparently didn't notice the eyes behind her, as she began to sing happily...

At first, Shi Yan was stunned. However, his eyes shamelessly scanned towards her bright fair skin, secretly admiring her enchanting ass, and wondering how her face would look like.

"Pa!"

The woman suddenly slapped on her smooth, white left hip to kill a mosquito. The movement of her butt captivated Shi Yan.

Soon the woman finished urinating, buckled her belt, and muttered to herself, "Damn mosquitos..."

Unexpectedly, the woman turned around quickly. Her hands sent out a green arc of lightning which targeted all the surrounding mosquitoes and killed them on the spot.

As she turned, Shi Yan finally saw her delicate appearance. She looked around 20 years old with five and a half feet in height. Her face was glowing like a bright moon and she had a slim waist, well-developed chest, and nice posture. She was wearing an exquisite lavender robe and soft silver armor which couldn't cover her fascinating figure as a legendary wild vixen.

Shi Yan focused on her hot body and thought that she was more beautiful than the most popular superstars in his world.

Shi Yan couldn't stop his eyes from wandering. Suddenly, the woman looked directly into his eyes though the huge banana leaves.

The beauty's eyes flashed like lightning!

Chapter 3: First Fight!

Translator: - -  Editor: - -
First Battle!

"Did you see me naked?" The beauty clenched her teeth tightly, with rage in her eyes.

"Yes, I never miss anything in front of my eyes." Shi Yan nodded, not even bothering to deny it.

"Did you enjoy it?"

"Skin like porcelain, breasts like flowers. I'd say it was a feast for the eyes." Shi Yan was strangely honest, without the slightest bit of shame.

"You want to see some more?" Mo Yanyu's delicate body trembled with anger. She had never met such a shameless man.

"Well, if you wouldn't mind taking your pants off, and don't mind me staring at you, then yes, I would love to take a closer look." Shi Yan smiled.

Apparently, Shi Yan didn't want to pretend to be somebody he was not. Before he came to this world, every time he finished some extreme sport, he would have to find a woman for pleasure. Extreme sports was his biggest enthusiasm, while women were the essential spices in his life.

Mo Yanyu almost jumped up and down on her feet.

Who the hell is this guy?! What a bastard! He appeared out of nowhere like a ghost. Every word he says is shameless and he appears to be proud of himself. In a competition for shameless bastards, he would be holding the crown.

Mo Yanyu had to take a deep breath before she began to talk again, while her beautiful breasts heaved up and down, a surge of rage bloomed in her chest. Surprisingly, she laughed, "Good! Very Good!"

Hearing her say this, Shi Yan became gleeful, and a horny smile appeared on his face. "Wow, it seems you don't mind at all. Well then, please go ahead. I am really looking forward to it. Last time I didn't pay much attention, but this time I won't miss anything."

Mo Yanyu was completely shocked by Shi Yan's response. After she figured out he wasn't teasing, she couldn't control her rage anymore. "Won't miss anything my ass!"

Cursing, Mo Yanyu crossed her arms. Suddenly, shining green light appeared on her hands. She spread her arms, shooting a green beam as quick as lightning towards Shi Yan.

[Verdant Crescent Slash][1]

Everything between them was cut into pieces as a green arc-shaped light flashed by. With an unstoppable force, the green lightning struck Shi Yan's right in the chest.

"Boom!"

Shi Yan was tossed backward on the ground. His skeleton-like weak body couldn't balance himself and he fell hard into a bush.

His chest was badly lacerated to the point where even bones were visible. Blood gushed out of his wounds. That single hit almost killed him.

Following the [Verdant Crescent Slash], the path between the two people was clear. What appeared to them was a small path with a burning scent.

Mo Yanyu moved towards Shi Yan, her face was as cold as ice.

Shi Yan finally came back to his senses. The intense pain in his chest made him realize that the girl in front of him wasn't easy to deal with.

In his previous world, if he did the same thing to a girl, the worst case scenario was the girl calling him an asshole or filing a lawsuit against him; but nothing like this.

He was still new to this place and was not used to the cruel way of life here.

Especially in the Dark Forest! Because this forest was not subjected to any country's jurisdiction and also contained a large variety of demon beasts as well as precious and exotic herbs, warriors used this forest as their training ground, while mercenaries and merchants saw this place as a natural treasure trove.

There were no restriction or rules in this forest. Due to the demon beasts and precious herbs, robbery and murder were common in this place. Even your companions would betray and backstab you at crucial moments. What an insane place!

The law of the jungle ruled the Dark Forest. The strong devoured the weak.

This was exactly why he got hit so hard. He let his guard down, never expecting a girl like her would attempt to kill him for such a trivial reason.

Shi Yan's mind was suddenly crystal clear.

The remaining Profound Qi inside of him gradually gathered around his wounded chest and began to heal him. With his Profound Qi moving around his body, the searing pain lessened.

Mo Yanyu footsteps echoed through the wet ground. Shi Yan jumped up nervously, calmed his mind, and looked straight at the girl walking slowly towards him.

"You intended to kill me?"

"Still breathing?" Mo Yanyu frowned slightly and stopped about 25 meters in front of Shi Yan. She took a curious but careful glance at him, and thought, "There is Profound Qi inside of him. A novice warrior. I should have hit him harder..."

Shi Yan was serious this time, with no more teasing or jokes. He focused his attention on the girl because he knew that she'd strike again soon.

He could feel his Qi was more concentrated than ever. This was a matter of life and death. He couldn't afford any mistakes. Shi Yan quickly adjusted himself and returned to the cool-headed state he always maintained during his extreme sports.

At that moment, he couldn't feel any pain in his chest. He could feel nothing but the weak Profound Qi flowing through his body and rushing through his veins, it kept getting faster and faster. The next moment, a wild surge of energy erupted from the deepest corner of his body. The feeling was mind-blowing. He felt like his brain had exploded. After that, the whole world suddenly became silent.

"Badump! Badump!"

Shi Yan could hear his own heartbeat loud and clear. With his heartbeat racing, the cells throughout his whole body were activated. Every inch of his body became sensitive and he could feel everything taking place around him. He could even feel the slightest tremor on his skin when a light breeze brushed against his body...

The strange energy started to spread from every pore of his body, pouring into his veins and bones. It felt like endless electricity was speeding throughout his entire vascular system.

After an acute pain in Shi Yan's eyes, the world in front of him became incredibly colorful and vivid. He was able to see the tiniest details on every leaf. He looked at the beautiful but cruel woman, feeling her Profound Qi flowing underneath her skin in a beautiful rhythm in her veins.

The forest was still the same. But to his eyes, it was like a completely different world out there.

Before Shi Yan could enjoy this wonderful feeling, he suddenly sensed that the Profound Qi inside the woman's body was flowing at twice as fast as before.

Shi Yan could even feel his nerves trembling.

Subconsciously, he pushed his left foot off the ground with all the force he had. With a strong power rushing out of his foot, Shi Yan quickly moved three meters away from where he was standing.

Another green blaze in the shape of a dagger grazed his side!

The green lightning cut everything by his side with a terrifying force. This time the attack was much more precise and stronger than the previous strike!

Sweat covered Shi Yan's back, he couldn't help but get excited.

Shi Yan suddenly realized that this type of fight, which could kill within seconds, was the most exciting and thrilling thing ever! He enjoyed this more than any kind of his extreme sports!

In the old world where he came from, there were all kinds of extreme sports available. However, he was bound like a prisoner in a cage of law, moral codes, and rational thinking. He couldn't do things without boundaries, he couldn't fully indulge in his passion, couldn't go beyond the boundary of law and moral codes.

But here, in this world where only the powerful ruled, nothing was prohibited. Nothing was impossible!

Shi Yan suddenly felt the excitement growing inside of him. He felt this might be the right place for him. This might just be his paradise!

...

"Hey!" Mo Yanyu couldn't hide her surprise. She didn't expect Shi Yan to evade this attack. She was sure that he would be torn to pieces by this strike and didn't prepare for Plan B.

Hearing her voice, Shi Yan who was still enjoying his survival had just now come back to his senses.

Without hesitation, Shi Yan jumped up like an agile monkey. He grabbed a vine on a tree and swung himself forward. He then grabbed another vine with lightning speed, flew forward, and reached for the next vine. In a series of smooth movements, he managed to approach Mo Yanyu within seconds.

When he was bouldering, the vines on the mountain were indeed a handy tool. For an extreme sports enthusiast like Shi Yan, swinging with the support of vines was like child's play.

Like a wild monkey, Shi Yan quickly moved through the vines and trees. He didn't follow a specific pattern but still managed to approach Mo Yanyu.

With a scorn on her face, Mo Yanyu shot more and more green light daggers into the sky, destroying every vine in the direction of Shi Yan. However, he was able to escape her attacks by a hair's breadth every time and quickly grasp another vine.

The truth was, Shi Yan could already sense the movement of Qi in Mo Yanyu's body. Everything was crystal clear to him now. When he saw a surge of Profound Qi underneath her skin, he would quickly move in another direction.

During his movements, Shi Yan started to feel that the blood in the pool had changed him somehow. He was not that strong before, but now, not only did the high-intensity movements not tear him apart, they made him even more sensitive and agile than ever before. His senses became sharper and his body became stronger and more flexible.

"Swish!"

With a loud noise, a sharp green lightning flew towards him, tearing apart dozens of vines behind him. Apparently, Mo Yanyu almost exhausted her Profound Qi after such strong attacks.

"This is my chance!"

Shi Yan suddenly jumped down from the trees and took Mo Yanyu in his arms like a greedy eagle. Before she could gather enough Profound Qi to strike back, Shi Yan was already on top of her.

"Boom!" Mo Yanyu fell on the ground with Shi Yan on top of her, tightly bringing her body under his control.

Face to face, Shi Yan could feel her soft body more closely. Her plump breasts felt so delicious and fragrant, he squeezed the buns up close to his burning chest.

Shi Yan felt unspeakable pleasure, while secretly appreciating the woman's body. What a piece of art! Unlike the ordinary women from his old world who used bras to look sexy and plump.

"Let go of me!" Mo Yanyu expressed her disgust but didn't really struggle. She cursed, "If you want an easy death, fucking let go of me right now! "

"Bitch!" Shi Yan sneered, "You almost fucking killed me. Why should I let you go so easily?"

Mo Yanyu suddenly became nervous. Before she could do anything, she felt this creep's kiss on her beautiful and sacred face. At the same time, the bastard's hands didn't rest either. Shi Yan was touching her ass and began to rub it in an insatiable way...

Mo Yanyu flew into a rage, the Martial Spirit inside of her exploded with a terrifying power.

Shi Yan who was still enjoying this wonderful feast suddenly felt a horrible electric current flowing through her. He was instantly electrocuted as if he had been struck by a taser. Shi Yan couldn't feel his own body anymore, nor could he gather any Qi inside his body.

Mo Yanyu pushed Shi Yan away, her eyes were cruel and icy. She glanced at Shi Yan who was lying on the ground for a while, and cursed again:

"I won't let you die that easily you bastard!"

Mo Yanyu picked Shi Yan up like a feather, passing through the forest towards the crowd with a cold face.

Chapter 1: The Aspiring Youth Expresses No Anxiety

Translator: TransN  Editor: TransN
It was a hot autumn afternoon. The sun was still blazing at 3 o'clock, dressing the black exterior walls of a large gymnasium in gold.

Large black letters were glimmering above the front entrance of the gymnasium, stating its name:

"Songcheng University Martial Arts Club!"

Looking from afar at the letters and the youths full of vigor and vitality streaming inside the gymnasium, Lou Cheng felt the vibrancy but hesitated to join them. He swallowed a lump of saliva down his throat and seemed to be bothered by the feeling that one would experience when returning home, though sure enough martial arts and the club had never been his home.

He could not help but turn to look at his roommate, Cai Zongming, who was standing nearby, seeking some psychological comfort.

They met upon entering the university and soon became close friends, as birds of a feather. After the military training and course selection, they developed a friendship where they could comfortably exchange good-natured banters with each other.

Cai Zongming was over 1.8 meter in height and topped Lou Cheng by half a head. Lou Cheng had to admit that the tall and handsome Cai Zongming had the figure of some appealing heroes in Wuxia novels. Also, he was born in an affluent family and had good taste in clothing, adding points to his charm. His only problem would be his gift of the gab!

"Cheng, why are you so nervous?" Cai Zongming noticed Lou Cheng's abnormal emotions and asked, still keeping his hands in the pockets of his cream-colored slacks. "It's just an orientation of the Martial Arts Club, and many students, like Old Qiu, won’t come to the orientation of Martial Arts Club. He just signed up but didn’t show up, instead, he went for self-study. It is not an examination, so why are you so concerned?"

Lou Cheng thought about it and found himself in need of advice. He carefully selected his words and asked his friend, this time using his nickname:

"Casanova, do you remember the girl we met when we signed up?"

Claiming to have dated many girls, Cai Zongming was experienced and good at fabricating wild tales, which earned him the title "Casanova" among his roommates. Lou Cheng considered him a good consultant on love-related problems...

"Yes! How could I forget? Over one month here, I've only met two or three girls of her league. I would have accosted her, had I no true love!" Cai Zongming took a glance at Lou Cheng and smiled. "So what's the story? Having a crush on her? Longing to pursue her? You seemed like an honest and ponderous guy when I first met you. Cheng, I didn't expect this from you!"

Lou Cheng hurried to clear himself. "Actually, I've known her since high school. We were in adjoining classes and we would stand right next to each other during the setting-up exercise to music. Day after day... You know?"

"Sure! Wait, does she know you?" Cai Zongming could barely keep a straight face.

Lou Cheng shook at the mouth and glowered at Cai Zongming. Finally, he gave in and said in a low voice, "Not really…"

"I see... An unrequited love... Perfectly normal," Cai Zongming stopped teasing him. "No wonder you dragged me to join the Martial Arts Club. I thought you had somehow found out my hidden martial skills!"

"Bah! You are mere an Amateur Fifth Pin! What hidden martial skills are you talking about?" counterattacked Lou Cheng.

Until today, martial arts had run a long course of thousands of years. Neither a tale nor a myth, it carried on and on through decades of confrontation against science and technology until it had to change its tradition to integrate into the modern society. Even the ranking system of martial arts had adapted to this era. A special Ranking Event would be held by the Martial Arts Association to assess martial artists with the First Pin being the highest rank, and Ninth Pin the entry level. Below the entry level was nine amateur Pins for martial enthusiasts who were more than sufficient to defeat the common mass.

Cai Zongming tut-tutted. "Someone is not even of Amateur Ninth Pin. Comparing to you, I'm certainly a master, right? Let's fight, and I'll use only one hand."

"Get lost," Lou Cheng cut him up and slowly walked forward after a deep breath. "She was very popular in my high school. I knew she was a fan of martial arts but I didn't know she had also entered Songcheng University. I saw it as some kind of destiny and was thrilled. So I dragged you into this to have more contact with her."

"Good. Reasonable enough," Cai Zongming took a few steps and suddenly burst into laughter. "Look, Cheng! Isn't that your goddess?"

With his heart thumping, Lou Cheng looked ahead following the direction Cai Zongming was pointing. Outside the main entrance of the Martial Arts Club gym there was a set of stairs with nine steps, on which he saw a girl in red and white traditional Han costume standing. Her small face was delicate and beautiful with exquisite features—a classic beauty from the south of the Yangtze River. She was Yan Zheke, the perfect girl Lou Cheng had constantly been thinking about. Her mother was from the south of the Yangtze River.

Lou Cheng was stunned. It was the first time he saw Yan Zheke in a Han costume. How gorgeous!

"How come she is working for the Martial Arts Club as a ceremonial usherette?" asked Lou Cheng with a confused look after he recovered from the shock.

She was also a freshman and the orientation was to take place today!

Cai Zongming laughed. "Simple. A girl of her league must have been contacted in advance by those senior members. Even if they can't win her heart, they can at least use her to promote the Martial Arts Club! Not like you, loser!"

"Aren't you the same…" Lou Cheng struck back.

"Well, actually, I'm not. I'm an Amateur-Fifth-Pin master, a future backbone for the Martial Arts Club…" Next, Cai seemed disturbed by some thought, "They should have contacted me in advance as well. An Amateur Fifth Pin is quite rare in Songcheng University Martial Arts Club. This year's freshmen are of this high quality? Besides that legendary Lin Que, would there be many of Amateur Third or Fourth Pin?"

While listening to Cai Zongming, Lou Cheng stared calmly at Yan Zheke standing on the steps like a star in the spotlight, outstanding and gorgeous, attracting all the attention. Many were probably ashamed of their appearance in front of her.

"Well, back to business. Cheng, here is a chance for you," Cai stopped talking to himself.

Lou Cheng turned and looked at him with dazed eyes. "What chance?"

"A chance to accost her! A chance to draw her attention." Cai Zongming heartily sympathized with this low-EQ pal.

"Accost her..." Looking at Yan Zheke from afar, Lou Cheng stammered, "Me?"

He had never accosted anyone before and was never thinking about it. Would it be a good idea?

Cai Zongming shook his head and tut-tutted, "Though it mainly depends on your appearance and eloquence, you will never succeed if you don't dare to give it a try. On most occasions, girls may condemn cowards. Don't you adore her? What kind of adoration is it if you don't even dare to pursue? Besides, you are very likely to succeed according to my analysis. She might not even consider it as accosting."

"Why?" Lou Cheng became interested.

"Has the crush reduced your IQ? You two were schoolmates from the same city. What a perfect start! Being in this strange land, far away from acquaintances, she will certainly regard you as her first choice when it comes to boys," Cai began to give an eloquent speech. "Imagine a young girl who has gone so far away from home for further education. Surrounded by strangers, how insecure she must be feeling now. Anyone with some common ground would be ideal for her to make friends with. As the saying goes, when two fellow townsmen meet each other, tears run down from four eyes. Not to mention you were once in the same grade of the same school! There are too many things for you guys to talk about, and the gap between you two is narrow.

"Just pretend to run into her and recognize her by chance. There is a ninety percent probability that you will get her QQ number or mobile number. Well, don't go too deep with her on your first encounter. Get her QQ number and retreat."

Lou Cheng carefully listened with a pounding heart. He was very tempted, as what Casanova just said made perfect sense.

However, he soon sank into another hesitation. "But a man average as me doesn't deserve her. I don't know if I can provide her the life she wants. Err... I'd better not…"

That was what would be called as diffidence.

Cai Zongming was shocked for quite a while.

"Cheng, isn't that too much at this moment? You don't even know each other yet, and you are already thinking about your married life with her? Your imagination impresses me…"

Giving Lou Cheng no chance to ponder further, Cai continued to persuade him. "Cheng, your intention to show responsibility and self-knowledge is good, but don't be a coward like this. We are in our first year in a pretty damn good university doing an okay major. Four years of hard study should easily get us a decent job after graduation. Don't you have this confidence? Or you are just going to be a quitter? Improve yourself and push yourself for her. Making yourself a better man for the one you love is true responsibility. Otherwise, your love for her will only move yourself. What counts is conscientiousness!"

Lou Cheng was amazed by Cai's words.

Cai Zongming waved his fist and jumped to another topic. "Nothing is set yet. It remains unknown whether you can win her heart or not. Your chance is pretty small... Err... Come on! Cheng, no regret. We try and try. The aspiring youth express no anxiety!"

Cai's speech turned Lou Cheng into an aggressive young man. His blood was boiling as he tried to suppress all the hesitation and concerns. Lou heavily nodded.

"I'll have a try!"

"Yes! Youth knows no failure!"

Looking at Yan Zheke's beautiful figure in red and white, Lou Cheng plucked up courage and was about to approach.

All of a sudden, Cai Zongming held him back.

"What's the matter?" Lou Cheng could feel his blood boiling.

Cai Zongming grinned. "Cheng, calm down. Your face is red like a monkey bum. She would be able to tell your attempt easily. Buy yourself a bottle of ice water to cool down first."

"Wow, Casanova, you are so experienced," Lou Cheng felt the heat on his face and almost stammered.

How exciting and frightening!

A good idea flashed across his mind. He took the opposite direction, ran away from the grand venue for a hundred meters and returned. By the time he passed Cai Zongming on his way back, he could barely catch his breath.

"You..." Cai Zongming was lost for a second before he got the point. He gave a thumbs-up, "Smart!"

A red face from running should be enough to cover his blush.

While Lou Cheng's heart was racing, his pace slowed down out of timidity. Soon, he picked up his pace and moved away from Cai. He clenched his hands and talked to himself, "Umm, at least I'll give it a try!"

He kept motivating himself while running toward the gymnasium and the beautiful figure in red and white.

Looking at his back, Cai Zongming hurriedly said, "Keep it short. You just met each other. Don't make it awkward. Leave a good impression for the future."

Lou Cheng waved to acknowledge his understanding and kept his pace up to get it done in one vigorous effort.

"This is youth..." A man with gray hair in his 70s or 80s was watching Lou Cheng from under a street tree by the pavement and got a bit sentimental. "I was once a young man just like him…"

Everyone has their youth!

Chapter 2: Everything Is Difficult at the Start

Translator: TransN  Editor: TransN
The front entrance was not that far away. Soon enough, Lou Cheng reached the gym and walked up the nine steps. His heart was pounding fast and he felt his face burning. It was hard to tell whether the panting and flush were from the long run or the upcoming accosting.

Rehearsing all the possibilities, Lou Cheng panted and clinched his hands to cheer himself up.

"What's there to fear? Man up!"

As different plots mingled in his mind for a few seconds, Lou Cheng slowed down and took frequent glances at the elegant Yan Zheke in that red and white Han costume, pretending she was just another person he was running by. Right before he brushed past her, he paused and asked in surprise, "You... Did you study in Xiushan No.1 Middle School?"

Yan Zheke stood there in amazement for a moment, as if she didn't hear him, but soon recovered and wiped the frown off. "Yeah. You are?"

Lou Cheng's heart was pounding hard but he managed to put on a smile under his heavy breath, "I was in class four. Every morning, I used to stand right next to you during the martial arts gymnastics. I mean, a few rows behind you... He-heh. Didn't know you were also here in Songcheng University."

Yan Zheke saw the light. Although she couldn't remember Lou Cheng, she lowered her guard and put on a smile along with two dimples. "I thought I was the only one from our high school here."

Keeping Cai Zongming's instruction in mind, Lou Cheng resisted the urge to scratch his head and replied humbly, "I kept it low and was thus not familiar with students from other classes."

The smiling Yan Zheke became even more attractive. Lou Cheng could hardly move his eyes away from her.

Yan Zheke kept smiling without reluctance, showing her unfeigned joy, "What's your name? Maybe I have heard about you before? Your classmate Cheng Tao and his buddies attended our class."

Her voice was soft and gentle, without any shyness, as if she was born with this tone.

"Cheng Tao? He used to borrow my homework every day. I'm Lou Cheng, a nobody. I bet you don't know me," after a good funny line, Lou Cheng yielded to his impulse and continued, "But I know you, Miss Yan Zheke, one of the most popular girls in our grade... Actually, in the entire school. A girl smart and friendly as you are expected to go to the capital or Huahai for university. Who would have guessed you were here in Songcheng."

Hearing such a direct yet natural compliment, Yan Zheke turned her head and chuckled, "Had I come here because of an unsatisfying result at the college entrance examination, you would have offended me."

"Damn it! What is wrong with me? Thankfully goodness Yan Zheke didn't fail the exam..." Lou Cheng thought to himself, quite terrified and anxious as he thought about that possibility. He had almost thrown a "beautiful" in his compliment as well, but luckily he found it too flippant for their first conversation.

"No wonder Casanova warned me not to talk too much... He knows this kind of stuff." Recalling Cai Zongming's advice, Lou Cheng hastened to add, "It would be news if a celebrity like you failed the exam. Err... The crowd is coming. I'd better get going. I shall leave you with your work."

"Got it," answered Yan Zheke.

Lou Cheng took a deep breath and tried to put up a casual tone, "What's your QQ number, by the way? A few more students from our school are also here. We can have a get-together."

He held his breath and his heart stood still. The last sentence was merely an excuse to cover up his true intention of having her QQ number!

Yan Zheke smiled and pointed at a red string around her neck without hesitation, "Can't keep my mobile in this suit. Take my QQ number and I'll add you soon. Don't forget to mention ‘Lou Cheng from class four, No. 1 Middle School.’ I don't accept requests from strangers. My QQ is XXXXXX."

"Got it," Lou Cheng was overjoyed and could barely remain calm. He repeated the number to himself and took out his mobile from the left pocket of his jeans. As soon as he logged in QQ and searched the number, a laugh broke out, "Dantai Cuihua?"

What a ridiculous name! The Yan Zheke online was the complete opposite from her real self...

Yan Zheke squinted to him a naughty smile, "Yeah, don't you find the name super approachable?" She added on after a pause, "Don't you know its provenance?"

"The one that ruined all those fancy, elegant compound surnames," Lou Cheng didn't know but it was not hard to guess.

Murong, Huangfu, Shangguan, Zhuge, Dantai… These special compound surnames with a beautiful given name would be perfect for characters in those romantic books or TV series. However, it could become hilarious given a boorish or patriotic add-on, such as Murong Jianjun, Huangfu Sufen, and Shangguan Weiguo.

Yan Zheke had joy in her eyes, "Yeah, isn't it interesting?"

"Very. Should I change my QQ name to Zhuge Ergou?" Lou Cheng enjoyed talking with Yan Zheke so much that he wished it could go on and on until a sudden cough came from behind him, as Cai Zongming approached.

Lou Cheng made great efforts to restrain himself and then he waved at Yan Zheke, "My friend is here. We have to go inside. See you."

"Bye," Yan Zheke waved back, which attracted quite some attention from others.

Lou Cheng turned around to join Cai Zongming, unable to mask his joy.

"Not bad! I thought you would stammer. You've got potential." As Cai Zongming walked through the entrance, noise and bustle reached them, to the point where he no longer needed to whisper.

The martial arts gymnasium was split into two connected sections, of which one was laid as a ring of the size of a basketball court, surrounded by stands of seats, and the other had the size of four to five basketball courts and had all kinds of sports apparatus for daily martial training. The latter was decorated as the venue for the orientation, which was busier than Lou Cheng had expected.

"Seriously," Lou Cheng laughed, "The Martial Arts Club really is a big family."

"Of course. The Martial Arts Competition is the world's most popular competition, and martial arts masters are the world's most popular stars. For sure the Martial Arts Club is the largest in every university."

Being the "best" writer is as meaningless as being the "second best" fighter¹. After decades of peace, more and more martial tournaments were taking place these days and the extreme excitement from these limit-redefining competitions could boost the audience's adrenaline level and arouse their heroism. It seemed those night prowlers were no longer an issue, and cowardice was cured for good. As this trend carried on, media and the show biz quickly caught up and official martial arts competitions came into existence.

Martial arts competitions could be simply classified into two groups: one was a derivative of the traditional conflicts among different martial factions, in which various martial sects, schools and clubs participated in a team event to fight for the honor of the greatest heir of Chinese martial arts; the other was held for individuals to compete for the championship.

The former had become a national craze known as the Professional Martial Arts Competition, which was comprised of four leagues, with the premier one containing 12 teams representing the highest martial arts level in China. For those 12 teams, the worst humiliation they could ever suffer was to rank bottom in their league, thus degrading to a lower one.

As for the latter, there were five national individual challenge tournaments, also known as Title Competitions. The champion of each of these tournaments would win the corresponding title and be acknowledged as one of the most capable martial artists in the country. For example, when someone won the championship of the Warrior Sage Event, he would hold the title Warrior Sage for the following year. So, a saying went "A title tops the Professional First Pin!"

Such tournaments could bring a pleasing commercial return for the leading forces and martial arts masters. Wealth came hand-in-hand with honor, popularity and far-reaching influence. Even universities were under the impact, bringing about the National University Martial Arts Competitions and flourishing the university martial arts clubs.

Cai Zongming straightened his back to show bearings of a hidden martial arts master and asked, "Have you got her QQ number?"

QQ number? Lou Cheng could not hide his joy, "Of course! Casanova, what should I do next?"

"What do you think? Find topics to chat with her, get closer to her, learn her hobbies and wait for an opportunity to ask her out. Finding topics shouldn't be hard, right?" Cai Zongming took a contemptuous glance at Lou Cheng and joked along. "Or give me her QQ number and I'll do it for you!"

"No way," Lou Cheng cut straight to the point, "So lucky to have advice from the experienced."

"Sure you are. I have dated lots of girls," Cai Zongming sounded very pleased with himself.

Playing on the downside all this time, Lou Cheng's mind clicked and murmured at Cai, "How old are you again?"

"Eighteen. So? Can't I have many girlfriends? I met my first love in Grade Three!" Cai Zongming didn't seem to like being doubted about his strong point.

"No. I mean... You've had so many girlfriends over the years, but none of your relationships lasted. It must be your fault…" Lou Cheng's eyes flashed all over Cai. He seemed to come to some realization.

Cai Zongming's face turned stiff as he complained, "Do you want to continue this conversation or not?"

Then he casually threw a brief explanation, "I've dated my pen friends. You know, easy come, easy go. A lack of contact for a short period was enough to kill the passion. Some of my dates transferred to another school. What could I do? And some were just not right... You know the song ‘it is easy to fall in love but hard to be together morning and night’. In short, I'm not a playboy and I've been behaving for a long time. Don't you call me a playboy or Casanova in front of my girlfriend! Actually, can't you give me a better nickname? Casanova is terrible. Stop calling me that, OK?"

"You got it, little Ming," Lou Cheng grinned.

Cai Zongming seemed to freeze and then heaved a sigh, "Casanova is fine."

"Yes, little Ming." Lou Cheng scored one and instantly cheered up.

There was always one thing to conquer another. Cai Zongming valued his current long-distance girlfriend in the same way Lou Cheng did for Yan Zheke.

Cai Zongming burst into laughter.

"Cheng, if we signed up for Crosstalk Club instead of the martial arts one, we would be famous for certain."

His voice was followed by a sudden turmoil outside the door.

"Lin Que is coming!"

"Lin Que!"

The crowd began to move toward the entrance.

Lou and Cai exchanged a glance with excitement, thrill and curiosity. They joined the mass toward the entrance.

Rumors had been spreading that a genius who had achieved the Professional Ninth Pin certificate at the age of 18 had joined the club at the entry level of professional martial arts, Lin Que had surpassed the majority of disciples of martial sects and students of martial arts schools.

A talent as him entered a university instead of any martial sect, school or club!

Among freshmen of the universities circle, Lin Que was not the only one who gained the Professional Ninth Pin. But for Song Cheng University, it was its first time to receive such a genius.

That genius was Lin Que!

Chapter 3: A Real Man Is Like That

Translator: TransN  Editor: TransN
The crowd was jostling inside the gym. Fortunately, Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming had just made their way in, so they were close enough to the door to see two figures walking through it.

A man in suit with saggy cheeks and wrinkles at the corners of his eyes had his hair combed back. Appearing to be the coach of the Martial Arts Club, he walked at a steady pace while looking around solemnly. His solemnity softened when he turned to the man in jeans and a white t-shirt next to him, who was half a head taller than him. Slender and with short hair, this fresh-looking young man was carrying a bulging black gym bag on his back.

"He must be the legendary Lin Que," Lou Cheng thought.

Lin Que's appearance quickly quieted down the gymnasium, like a silencer. He remained cool and continued walking despite all the eyes locked on him, filled with curiosity, excitement, and adoration. He gave a gentle nod without a word when he was introduced by the coach, and then he was led through the crowd straight into the locker room, as if he were a celebrity.

The short silence was replaced by a fervent discussion as soon as his figure disappeared.

"So cool!"

"The Martial Arts Club does have handsome boys!"

"How charming and challenging!"

These were some comments from the girls.

"What's that apathy for…"

"The capable ones are never easygoing."

"If I had the rank of Professional Ninth Pin, I would be just as proud as him!"

"Our club is going to rock!"

"Yeah, when we defeat Guannan and Neihai, they can be arrogant no longer!"

"We might reach the amateur fifth or sixth pin by the university graduation with his help. One more way to make a living..."

Those comments were from the boys.

As Lou Cheng withdrew his eyes, he happened to notice Yan Zheke in that red and white Han costume by the door. Her face and eyes were filled with admiration, just like the other girls.

"Sign... How much I envy him!" Lou Cheng complained to Cai Zongming. "I wish I were of Professional Ninth Pin to enjoy this."

Cai Zongming tut-tutted. "It is a good time to quote some classic to show your literature skills. You should say 'a real man is like that'!"

"A real man is like that..." After a moment of reflection on it, Lou Cheng took a glance at Yan Zheke and quipped to Cai Zongming. "And you will then say 'I can replace him'?"

"You really are my bosom friend." Cai Zongming laughed and raised one arm with a clenched fist to show his muscle. "Though I skipped quite some martial arts training sessions, I've made it to Amateur Fifth Pin. Imagine if I take it super seriously. I'll reach Professional Ninth Pin in no time and become the most charming man in the Martial Arts Club!"

"You are probably the only one that can talk about skipping classes this proudly." The two continued to exchange good-natured banters.

After a while, Yan Zheke went into the women's locker room.

The Orientation started on time. As the light was turned on, a muscular man stepped into the ring.

"Everybody, I am Chen Changhua in my senior year, manager of this Martial Arts Club…" In a black leotard, Chen Changhua looked sharp and husky. As he went on to introduce himself with a big smile, his fierce look softened.

"Ha-hah! Check out his eyebrows. They remind me of the song 'Bugs flying o bugs flying'..." whispered Cai Zongming to Lou Cheng during Chen Changhua's speech.

Lou Cheng glanced at him. "Casanova, you really should join the Crosstalk Club. Don't waste your talent!"

Their whispering back and forth seemed to have no impact on Chen Changhua's introduction.

"As you all know, Martial Arts Realm has four stages - body refining, Qi, invulnerability, and restriction. The latter two are out of our concern today, as the amateurs are probably never gonna get there. So I'll focus on explaining body refining and Qi. The body refining stage is all about training our body like refining pills of immortality or smelting metals. It requires coordination from many aspects. A trance training or a session in the weight room is far from enough.

"I'm telling you this because I want you to know that no prior martial arts training experience is okay. We will help you with it. The Songcheng University Martial Arts Club has a long history and our body refining training is professional and proper to the tradition, nothing like that taught in those random martial arts clubs or gyms. Commit yourself to it for the next four years and you will easily reach the rank of amateur fifth or fourth pin, which will be enough to get you a coaching position in any martial arts club or gym. Then, you will have one more way to make a living.

"If some of you are true martial arts enthusiasts, you do have a chance to pass the Ranking Event and rank Professional Ninth Pin. I don't have a special gift in martial arts but I'm hard-working. Last year I got my Amateur First Pin certificate and now I'm preparing for the coming Ranking Event. So you know the Professional Ninth Pin is totally possible for us Songcheng University Martial Arts Club members. Diligence and devotion will get you everything!

"Of course, if you are a real talent, it is also possible to break through the body refining state and enter the Qi practice. Shanbei University has a genius who's been giving us lots of trouble whenever we encounter…"

Lou Cheng frowned in confusion and turned to Cai Zongming. "Shanbei University got last year's championship of the university martial arts event?"

"That's right," nodded Cai Zongming.

Lou Cheng asked with some hesitation. "Chen Changhua's words sounded a bit weird, didn't they?"

It seemed that he was secretly alluding to someone...

"Weird for sure. He's talked so much and I'm gonna summarize it into two sentences. First, Professional Ninth Pin is not that rare, so Lin Que is not a big deal." Cai Zongming laughed before continuing, "Second, our Martial Arts Club is not doing very well because our competitors are too strong!"

Having his suspicion confirmed, Lou Cheng shook his head. "Chen Changhua seems to have a problem with Lin Que. But isn't it bad for him to say it out loud?"

"Whatever. It has nothing to do with us." Cai Zongming got bored and took out his mobile.

Finally, Chen Changhua finished his long speech and put on a smile.

"Well, now let me introduce you our senior members. They all have experience in the Ranking Event and they are of Amateur Sixth Pin or higher…"

Before Lou Cheng could raise his head to have a proper look, Cai Zongming pulled at his clothes.

"Come on. Let's go back," Cai Zongming lowered his voice.

Lou Cheng didn't expect this. "Now? It's still early."

"Are you waiting to meet those senior members? Come on! You are here for a girl. Do you actually think yourself an undiscovered talent who had no basic training in his first 18 years but will just achieve enlightenment all of a sudden and rocket to become a martial arts master greater than all the senior members? Do you see yourself winning the championship of the National Martial Arts Competitions for Songcheng University and attract attention from the top guys to start your rising to the peak of your life with money and women?" Cai Zongming indeed had talents in joking.

Lou Cheng laughed with embarrassment. "We are already here. Let's stay and see."

Cai Zongming looked around and said, "You are just gonna mess around here until you get your girl. What's the point in meeting the senior? I can teach you anyway..."

Cai Zongming lowered his voice. "If you leave now, you will have one more pretext to talk with your goddess."

"Ha?" Lou Cheng was lost.

"Think about it. You make up some excuse to leave early and later you can ask her what you have missed. Schedule for training sessions or anything. A conversation starts naturally without making yourself an aversion of hers. Then, you can easily move on to other topics," Cai Zongming spoke with fervor.

Lou Cheng gazed at him for a few seconds.

"Little Ming, I admire only you among all the roommates!"

"Call me Casanova, please!" Cai Zongming slightly bent over and made his way toward the exit while the senior members were going into the ring. Lou Cheng followed behind him.

As soon as they got out, Lou Cheng was surprised to see an artistic man was filming them with an eye-catching camera.

"Damn! My skipping martial arts lesson is going on television?"

A young girl in a classic office outfit stood next to the cameraman.

Seeing Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming walking out, the young girl, with some nerdy looks, approached with a bright smile.

"Hello! I'm a reporter from Songcheng TV Station. Do you have time for a quick interview?"

With a refreshing short haircut, long dark eyebrows, clear eyes and a cute nose, she looked like a fresh graduate with a pair of dimples when she smiled. The identity card placed in front of her chest had her name, Shu Rui.

"What interview?" asked Lou Cheng to the microphone.

"No problem," Cai Zongming answered with no hesitation.

They looked into each other's eyes and saw mutual disdain.

The reporter Shu Rui raised her pretty oval face and smiled. "Are you members of the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club?"

"Damn! We are caught skipping class on site..." Lou Cheng thought as he scratched his head before replying, "Yeah. We... We've got an emergency."

"Yes, an emergency that we have to leave early," answered Cai Zongming calmly.

Shu Rui didn't seem to care. She maintained her professional smile. "Did you see Lin Que earlier in there?"

"Yeah." Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming looked at each other with astonishment as they heard the interview was about Lin Que.

It actually made sense to see a reporter there considering Songcheng University was the best university of the city and martial arts was the hottest sport these days.

Shu Rui gave another smile. "Lin Que is the very first freshman of Professional Ninth Pin in the history of Songcheng University. What do you think about his decision to join the Martial Arts Club? Any opinion?"

"Pretty good. Our martial arts club can probably make it to the next level," answered Cai Zongming, grinning.

Lou Cheng smiled sincerely. "Very excited. I'm actually thrilled. We are lucky to have him."

Shu Rui withdrew the microphone and her eyes were sparkling. "Thank you for taking this interview."

Watching the reporter and cameraman enter the gymnasium, Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming spoke at the same time.

"Cheng, was my smile a bit stiff?"

"Casanova, was my smile a bit silly?"

They shared some laughter and the tension faded away.

"It's gonna be my first time on TV. Kinda weird," Lou Cheng rubbed his cheeks.

Cai Zongming grinned. "Me too. Well, they might not use it. Lin Que is the key. He-heh. The reporter was not bad, beautiful, pure and in very good shape. Did you notice her legs? Longs and straight. I like her better than your goddess."

"Hello, 911? I'm calling to report a pervert," Lou Cheng took out his phone on purpose.

"Get lost!" Cai Zongming complained. "Just kidding."

Lou Cheng laughed. "Well, when I meet my sister-in-law someday, I'll tell her that Little Ming has been behaving!"

They chatted and laughed on the way back to the dormitory and soon threw the interview behind.

The dormitory of Songcheng University were two-bedroom flats with a basic living room, a balcony for laundry to the left and a bathroom and separated squatting toilet to the right. Two bedrooms, one on each side of the aisle, were shared by eight students altogether, each having their own bed on top of their desk, next to their wardrobe.

The two were not in the same bedroom. As soon as they entered the living room, Cai Zongming took out his mobile. "Cheng, I'll make a phone call. Wait for me to have dinner together."

"Huh. How sweet!" Knowing Cai Zongming would spend hours on the phone with his girlfriend, Lou Cheng decided to play some computer games in his room.

Walking into the empty room, Lou Cheng knew his three roommates were still in the study hall.

"So hard-working..." He felt embarrassed seeing their diligence.

The time was a bit awkward, not enough to finish a game but too much to be doing nothing. Lou Cheng soon calmed himself down and signed in the forum.

That was a platform hosting a collection of different forums. There was a forum for pretty much anything you could think of and it had quite some users. Lou Cheng was visiting the Longhu Club.

Longhu Club was in the premier league of the Professional Martial Arts Competition and was one of the most competitive forces for the title of the most powerful heir of Chinese martial arts. Founded just over three decades ago, it was like a little baby compared to those sects with a history of hundreds of years. This young club and its martial arts school for different age groups had been challenging those noble, ancient and influential sects and had scored a good number of victories. Chen Qitao, known as the Dragon King and who was also one of the Legendary Twins of the modern martial arts world, was the best example of Longhu Club's excellent members.

Such a martial arts club with such a matchless martial artist was certainly charming, and Lou Cheng was one of its numerous fans.

In the forum, Lou Cheng subconsciously put on a wicked smile and used the name Schrodinger's Tiger to post.

"Urgent! Just joined a Martial Arts Club today. How can I appear to be a frequenter?"

Book 1, Chapter 1 – Punishment Court

June, some island in Indonesia, the sun was shining brightly.

An antique Chinese designed building hidden among the green woods. Copper colored pillars, natural green with a hint of brown colored roof tiles and roof corners pointing upwards like an eave. There was a Divine Beast statue made from tri-colored pottery on top of the roof. Everything about this building was mysterious and solemn. (1)

This was Underhand Sect’s headquarter.

In the last building in this courtyard stood a small black building made of stone. On top of the door leading into the building was a blood red signboard with two words, ‘Punishment Court’ was neatly curved on it.

The Punishment Court in the Underhand Sect is responsible for punishment and sentences, all the disciples of the sect would tremble with fear upon hearing its name.

Within the main hall of the Punishment Court, there lay an altar in the middle of the hall. Spirit tablets of the Underhand Sect Grandmaster and the patriarchs of the different generations were placed and worshipped on it. Underneath these spirit tables, four big chairs lined up in a straight line. The underhand sect’s Punisher, Commander, Instructor and Guardian were sitting on the 4 chairs.

On both left and right side of the hall, nearly a hundred disciples of the Underhand Sect were standing formally. Some were tall, some were short. Some were fat, some were skinny. Some were good looking, some were ugly. All kinds of appearances were here. Some of them wore suits, some were shirtless. Some wore long gowns, while some wore street jackets. Some of them looked no different than a gangster on the streets, and their appearances were weird as well.

All disciples were focusing on themselves. They remained silent and dared not show any disrespect, they even tried breathing as softly as they could, afraid they would disturb the hall’s stern atmosphere and get scolded by the Punisher.

Wu Wang wore a long green shirt, he cupped his fists and bowed politely towards the four elders who held the power of this sect.

“Elders, Shangguan Ye who violated the rules of the sect and behaved outrageously has been caught alive! I request Elder Punisher to punish him according to the rules of the sect!”

All four elders of the Underhand Sect had gloomy expressions. Elder Punisher gazed at Wu Wang and waved his hand slightly, he cleared his throat and said, “Substitute Elder, where is Shangguan Ye?”

Wu Wang showed a watery smile as he turned his head around and beckoned. Wu Qi and a few other men looking as strong as wolves came in carrying a middle aged man who was tied by a rope like a dumpling. The middle aged man’s mouth was filled with two walnuts, he stared angrily at Wu Wang as he kept making a ‘wu wu’ sound, but he was unable to say a single word.

After throwing Shangguan Ye onto the floor, Wu Qi squeezed his mouth a few times with a smile, then he took out the walnuts in his mouth.

Although Shangguan Ye was tied like a dumpling, he was still flexible like a money. Just right after Wu Qi took the walnuts out of his mouth, he twisted his body and jumped up. He casually stood up in the middle of the Punishment Court.

Staring angrily at Wu Wang, Shangguan Ye roared out crazily, “Wu Wang! How dare you ask someone to catch me?!”

Wu Wang showed a sneer smile. Wu Qi kicked Shangguan Ye’s foot, forcing him to kneel down.

With one hand pressing down on Shangguan Ye’s shoulder, Wu Qi smiled gently and said, “Uncle Shangguan, my master is the Substitute Elder.”

Shangguan Ye struggled violently, he roared out like an animal, “Fucking Substitute Elder! Bullshit Substitute Elder! Wu Wang, I won’t submit to you! I will not submit to you! My dad was the previous Sect Elder, the Sect Elder position should be mine! It is mine!”

Wu Wang smiled as he took a few steps back.

Elder Punisher gazed at Wu Wang whose face had a big smile, he suddenly stomped hard on the ground and shouted, “Ridiculous! Shangguan Ye, look carefully, where are you right now?!”

Shangguan Ye’s body trembled, he rolled his eyes as he looked at Elder Punisher who had a stern face and said with a cold smile, “Where am I now? This is the Punishment Court! What mistake have I, Shangguan Ye, done to make the Punishment Court want to punish me? Elders, look at how honorable I, Shangguan Ye am, do I really deserve this?”

All four elders furrowed their brows. They peeked at the man who stood behind Wu Wang, Le Xiaobai who had long hair and a skinny body like a wandering soul.

Taking a long sigh, Elder Punisher shouted with a deep voice, “Shangguan Ye, three months ago, did you strike continuously? Did you bring out disciples to steal from 17 families?”

Raising his head straight, Shangguan Ye smiled coldly and said, “That’s right, but what’s wrong about that? We are the Underhand Sect, isn’t stealing what we are supposed to do?”

Wu Wang smiled slightly, he held his hands behind his back and said nothing.

Le Xiaobai waved his big folding fan and took a few steps forwards. With a cold smile he said, “Yes, we are the Underhand Sect, what we do here is a thief’s dirt work.”

Taking a long sigh, Le Xiaobai said with a compassionate voice, “But, there’s a saying that even thieves have their morals. The rules set by the founding Grandmaster is; even we in the Underhand Sect were about to die of poverty or hardship, we’ll never target innocent people!”

The folding fan knocked Shangguan Ye’s shoulder hardly. Le Xiaobai pointed at Shangguan Ye and scolded, “But Shangguan Ye, he continuously stole from 17 rich families, he even stole 6 family heirlooms. Those 6 families who had their heirlooms stolen are all good people who all do good deeds!”

Silence filled the Punishment Court, everyone looked at Le Xiaobai and Wu Wang.

Shangguan Ye twisted his body and tried jumping up, but Wu Qi pressed down on his shoulder, forcing him to stay where he was.

Suddenly, dozens of breaking noises sounded out. Shangguan Ye’s body twisted, and those ropes that were tightly tied around his body were all snapping. Both of Shangguan Ye’s arms were flexible like snakes. With some agile moments, the arms finally escaped, then they pressed towards Wu Qi’s stomach together with a cold wind.

Wu Qi laughed softly, both his palms moved so fast that only a shadow was visible. His shoulders twisted like there was no bones there, then he silently confronted Shangguan Ye.

A subtle impact sounded out, Wu Qi was still standing in his previous position, his feet hadn’t moved an inch, but Shangguan Ye was rolling around on the floor with blood dripping out of his mouth because of the impact.

Gazing at Wu Qi in shock, Shangguan Ye shouted fiercely, “Little bastard, you joined the sect not even three years ago, how come your palm’s strength is greater than mine?”

Wu Qi took two steps forwards and kicked Shangguan Ye’s chest, sending him flying up into the air. Wu Qi smiled and said, “Uncle Shangguan, as the son of the previous Sect Elder, not only did you violate the rules of this sect, you even attacked someone openly in the Punishment Court, your crime is now three times more severe! Are you going to commit to all the crimes you’ve committed?”

Wu Wang cleared his throat, Le Xiaobai turned back and fiercely gazed at all four elders.

All four elders squeezed their hands which were placed on the handle of their chairs, directly crushing it and turning it into ashes.

Elder Punisher took a long breath before he stood up and shouted angrily, “Men, Shangguan Ye first violated the rules of our sect, then he attacked someone openly in the Punishment Court! His crimes can’t be forgiven! Considering the fact that he is the previous Sect Elder’s only son, his sentence will be the disposal of all his skills and imprisonment underneath the ground of the Underhand Sect for the rest of his life!”

Le Xiaobai cupped his hands, shouting calmly in agreement.

All the disciples of the Underhand Sect in the Punishment Court clapped their hands together and said, “Elder Punisher is far with rewards and punishments! We, the disciples, are all convinced from deep within!”

Shangguan Ye stared at all the disciples with a startled look and shouted, “You guys… You guys!”

Elder Punisher stomped his feet and asked angrily, “Where’s the disciples of punishment?”

Wu Qi answered the call, he leapt towards Shangguan Ye, both palms moving like swallows flying through a forest. They hit every part of Shangguan Ye’s body.

Shangguan Ye barely managed to defend against Wu Qi’s first few attacks. Blood poured out of his mouth, then he finally lost all his energy. His Dantian was hit 18 times by Wu Qi. Wu Qi’s chilly palm forcefully penetrated Shangguan Ye’s Dantian and destroyed all the Inner Vital Energy that he had cultivated during the last 10 years.

After destroying all of Shangguan Ye’s skill by force, Wu Qi had a smile on his face that was not only gentle, but also friendly and affectionate.

“Uncle, it’s been a hard day for you, time for you to get some good rest.”

Without minding Shangguan Ye’s horrible scream, a thin black sharp blade appeared out from nowhere between Wu Qi’s fingers. The blade cut through the air faster than wind itself onto Shangguan Ye’s wrist, elbow, and all the joints. When the blade cut through the flesh, the razor sharp edge vibrated slightly, instantly cutting off a few important nerves in Shangguan Ye’s arm.

Shangguan Ye was screaming pitifully. Great amounts of blood poured out from his arms.

His Inner Vital Energy was gone, the nerves on both his hands were all cut. Shangguan Ye was now a crippled man.

Wu Qi kept smiling and said, “You have violated the rules of this sect. But, I’m sure you didn’t do it on purpose. I guess it was nothing but an unintentional mistake. But no matter what, the rules of this sect are to be obeyed! We, the Underhand Sect, can only survive in this world for so long, the rules cannot be broken!”

Sighing softly, Wu Qi looked at Shangguan Ye and said with a serious tone, “Sir, you can just rest assured! All the spending and consuming for the rest of your life will be handed by your responsible disciple, me!”

Shangguan Ye started at Wu Qi and started laughing painfully, he nodded his head and said, “Fine, fine, you rascal who is only worth $100, very good of you!”

Spitting a mouthful of blood onto Wu Qi, Shangguan Ye turned around. He gazed at the four elders while trembling and laughing coldly. He cursed grimly, then he finally stared towards Wu Wang.

“Seven years ago, my dad used the last drop of the ‘Mending and Patching Ointment’ and made your destroyed nerves connect. Today, your disciples abolished all my skills! Wu Wang, I, Shangguan Ye, will fight you till the end of my life!”

Wu Wang bowed to Shangguan Ye with a serious expression and said, “Senior Disciple Shangguan Ye, you have violated the rules of this sect, this is the punishment you deserve! The grave of teacher towards Wu Wang, I will remember for sure! In the future, senior disciple should just enjoy his retirement underneath the grounds of the Underhand Sect peacefully. All your expenses will be paid by me, Wu Wang, alone!”

Looking at Wu Qi with a praising expression, Wu Wang waved his hand and said, “Wu Qi, you have expressed your filial respect, but senior disciple Shangguan is your elder in this sect, how could he spend his junior’s time? Senior Disciples Shangguan will enjoy his retirement within the vicinity of the sect in the future, we all have to take good care of him!”

Wu Qi hurriedly bowed down respectfully.

Gazing at the disciples within the Punishment Court sternly, Wu Wang shouted seriously, “Remember this all of you, for the disciples of the Underhand Sect, anyone who dares violate the rules of our sect, let Shangguan Ye be your example!”

Wu Qi kept the small sharp blade between his fingers. He signaled a few disciples of punishment to drag Shangguan Ye away from here.

Shangguan Ye struggled violently, he raised his head and laughed in a horrifying manner, “Wu Wang, Le Xiaobai, Wu Qi, I won’t let any of you go! Hahaha, you’re dead meat, you’re just seeking death! And you four old fools, I won’t let any of you go either! I, Shangguan Ye, will exterminate all your families!”

Shangguan Ye was dragged out of the Punishment Court by force while laughing like a maniac.

Shangguan Ye’s horrifying screams could still be heard from afar.

“All of you, just wait! I’ll find each and every one of you and get my revenge!”

From the sleeve of the crazily struggling Shangguan Ye, a paper crane made with yellow paper suddenly burned itself to ashes without any fire in an instant.

Wu Wang stuck out his chest and stared at all the disciples in the Punishment Court, he spoke faintly, “Disciples of the Win Court, please go and gather information about the whereabouts of all the stuff stolen by Shangguan Ye. Never mind the unimportant stuff, but the 6 family heirlooms must be returned to their owners!”

Gazing at the four elders, Wu Wang said faintly, “The Underhand Sect’s rules cannot be broken while in our hands!”

The four elders looked at each other and sighed at the same time.

The Guardian trembled as he took out a palm sized golden plated box from a secret pocket near his chest, he took it out in a serious manner.

“Substitute Elder, this is the token of the Sect Elder. Except for Shangguan Ye, no one here is against the decision of making you the Sect Elder!”

All four elders cupped their fists and bowed politely towards Wu Wang, “We invite Substitute Elder to officially take command of the Underhand Sect!”

Every single disciple in the Punishment Court kneeled down together.

“We invite the Substitute Elder to officially take over the command of the Underhand Sect!”

Without showing shyness, Wu Wang took the head and nodded his head firmly.

Le Xiaobai and Wu Qi looked at each other, a smile appeared on their faces at the same time.

Book 1, Chapter 2 – Historical Relic

The lost mountain, Machu Picchu.

Down the hill on the tourist’s path towards Machu Picchu, local police had set up a roadblock, preventing the public to enter. The reason for this is that there is an important archeology assessment going on at Machu Picchu, so the public is prevented from even getting close to it.

At the border of Machu Picchu which was 2000 meters above sea level, three capable and vigorous disciples of the Underhand Sect were watching around alertly with micro machine guns.

Wu Qi was sitting on the wall of a building that had no roof. He admired the surrounding scenery with a can of beer in his hands and a smile on his face.

The surrounding mountain scenery in Machu Picchu was pretty amazing. Amazing green hills were everywhere, the morning fog was hovering around, mist dragon long white lines along the mountainside with the help of the morning wind. This place was like a fairy land people could only daydream about.

After drinking up the remaining beer, Wu Qi squeezed the beer can and threw it far away.

He unconsciously touched the secret pocket on his belt. The Sect Elder Token for the Underhand Sect was now laying quietly in his secret pocket.

According to the Underhand Sect’s rules, the Sect Elder Token has to be with the Sect Elder at all times, it can’t be anywhere else. But, Wu Wang is not someone who follows rules all the time, he was now with a group of elite disciples and was checking on Machu Picchu. He did not want to have an extra burden with him.

He handed over all his important things to Wu Qi who wasn’t familiar with the assessment on the historical relic. He brought a group of elite disciples himself, and right now he was busy working in the ruins of Machu Picchu.

In an abandoned temple about 200 meters away, Wu Wang who was only wearing underpants stood straight up. He coughed out loudly and spat out a thick sputum. It was heavily raining before this, the temple was filled with thick dust, the rain water and the dust mixed together became dirty mud. Wu Wang was now covered in this mud and looked like a wild monkey.

Throwing away the ultrasonic detector, Wu Wang took a few steps back and suddenly leapt forwards, hitting a brick in the corner of the temple with his palm. The instrument had detected something special in the temple, and with the experience and judgment of the Underhand Sect’s elite disciples, it was easy to find out that this brick was a switch that controlled some mechanism within the temple.

All of Machu Picchu trembled for a moment. Followed by Wu Wang’s forceful strike, the brick slowly submerged into the wall. In the hall without a roof on the east side of the temple, a few hundred carefully carved bricks laying on the floor quietly started sliding away, quietly submerging into the ground and showing an entrance to an underground passage which was large enough to allow three grown men to walk side by side.

Wu Qi grabbed a shark skin scabbard beside him, the handle was made with copper, and the locket was made with gold. Numerous gemstones were mounted on the scabbard itself.

This is a sword that an elder from the Underhand Sect three generations ago stolen from an ancient tomb underneath a Sword Pool. On the sword’s blade two words were carved in, ‘Dragon Abyss’. But, it was unknown whether or not this sword was the same Dragon Abyss sword as the one made by the legend Ou Yezi.

This Dragon Abyss sword is extremely sharp, combat knifes made with modern day alloys can’t even withstand a single light hit from it. As Wu Wang’s only successor, and being the disciple with the highest status in the Underhand Sect, Wu Qi obviously has the right to use it.

Dozens of capable and vigorous men from the ‘Greedy Wolf Group’ of the Underhand Sect carried a variety of weapons and followed closely behind Wu Qi.

The Greedy Wolf Group is an elite group. After Wu Wang joined the Underhand Sect, he spent a few years adopting orphans from different places and trained them to form a skilled team. Under Wu Qi’s lead, the Greedy Wolf Group played an important role in the fight for power amongst Wu Wang and Shangguan Ye.

Carrying the Dragon Abyss sword in his hands, Wu Qi led the group and entered the underground passage.

After taking a few steps into the passage, Wu Wang who was overexerted turned around and started dragging Le Xiaobai who looked unwilling to follow.

Wearing a long robe, the clean and tidy Le Xiaobai who looked like a noble young master who was about to eat dinner struggled. He shouted loud and said, “I can’t stand being dirty! I can’t stand being dirty! Big Brother, Sect Elder, Uncle Wu, I hate going underground, can you please not drag me along?”
[TL: He’s referring to Wu Wang in all 3]

Wu Qi remained silent as he grabbed a chunk of dirty mud from the mud pond on the ground in the dark, then he put some of it on Le Xiaobai’s face.

Le Xiaobai was startled. He started blankly at the dirty mud water that was dripping down from his face, his body started violently trembling.

“Wu Qi! You ungrateful brat! Have you forgotten who the one who brought you out from Africa was?!” Le Xiaobai’s folding fan almost touched Wu Qi’s nose.

Wu Qi’s lips twitched a little, he shrugged his shoulders and said, “Last year in Amsterdam, who was the one who had no money to pay for women and asked me to save him? You bought me with only $100 in Africa, that day I paid $3,800 for you! Even if we take the inflation into consideration, I’ve already repaid all your favors!”

Staring and the stunned and speechless Le Xiaobai, Wu Qi teased and said, “As the White Folding Fan of the Underhand Sect, you still let those little gangsters in Netherland steal your wallet… If the previous grandmasters of the different generations rose from their graves, they would strangle you to death while you’re asleep!”

Wu Wang started laughing out crazily. Le Xiaobai’s lips twitched for quite some time. Suddenly, he stomped his feet. He accepted his fate and threw away the folding fan. He undressed his long sleeve shirt and led the group forwards in low spirit.

With high intelligence like a freak and a body so thin that even the most famous catwalk models couldn’t compare, Le Xiaobai had mastered all the Underhand Sect’s books about traps and mechanisms, he even innovated some new techniques. As long as he led the way, there were basically no traps that could trouble Wu Wang, Wu Qi and the rest.

Wu Wang has strong leadership and organizational abilities.

Wu Qi has strong innate skills towards martial arts and combat skills.

But the one who really inherited the genuine skills that made the Underhand Sect famous was still Le Xiaobai.

Complaining and mumbling to himself, Le Xiaobai led all the men along the passage and slowly entered deep into the mountain. There were dozens of deadly traps hidden in the passage, but they were all cracked by Le Xiaobai with ease.

“I hate actions that insult my intelligence!” While breaking the traps along the way, Le Xiaobai kept mumbling to himself, “Intruding someone’s ancestor tomb, breaking in by force… This doesn’t involve any intelligence!”

Nobody really cared about Le Xiaobai’s mumbling.

Wu Wang brought a few of the disciples and set up some lights and ventilations along the passage. Wu Qi led the Greedy Wolf Group and carefully watched the surroundings. In this kind of historical relic, some strange things might happen.

Last year, they were in an underground tomb within the King’s Valley in Egypt, they met a mummy who was still alive. Wu Qi and over 30 Greedy Wolf Group elites fought a tough battle before finally dismembering that mummy.

The mysteriousness for the Inca remains is similar to Egypt. Wu Qi was prepared to strike his sword at all times.

Luckily, no abnormal accidents happened. After Le Xiaobei cracked 64 traps along the passage, everyone arrived at the end and stood in front of a huge metal door. The door was made with gold and silver, and there were numerous mysterious patterns on top of it.

The rectangular shaped door was 12 meters high with a width of 3 meters. The door reflected silver and golden colors when pointed at with the searchlight.

Le Xiaobai came closer to the door and forcefully impaled it with a needle.

“60% gold and 40% silver, the purity is pretty high. This door alone is worth more than all we spent to get here!”

After all these years in the Underhand Sect, Le Xiaobai had achieved an amazing assessment ability. By just slightly impaling the door with a needle, he had already analyzed all of the doors components. It was made with the purest gold and silver, 60% gold and 40% silver. The materials were so good that even if the door was just normal size, it would still be an astonishing fortune.

Wu Wang extended his hand and grabbed a golden plate with a polygonal sun shape on it, it closely resembled the Inca culture. Wu Wang looked at the door with a smile, “I’m really curious, if the front door is so expensive, what will be behind this door?”

Wu Qi stared at the door, suddenly he drew his sword. A layer of water shadows shot out from the scabbard, producing a sonic boom and hitting the door.

Wu Qi had amazing talent, after practicing with full effort for four years together with Wu Wang, his inner vital energy was almost at the same level as the four elders of the sect. The Dragon Abyss sword was an ancient sharp sword, the blade resembled water. When agitated by inner vital energy, the sword’s edge would spit out three inches of lightning, tearing the air apart as it flew towards its target.

After a loud bang, lightning started blinking around the huge door, an arm sized lightning bolt shot out from the door, violently striking the Dragon Abyss sword.

Wu Qi’s arms were affected by the lightning strike, the sleeve on his right harm was instantly turned into ashes. His body was covered in lightning, and he was sent flying away while swinging his arms and feet in midair from the explosion.

He felt extreme pain in his body, every single cell in his body had been penetrated by the high voltage. If it wasn’t for Wu Qi having strong inner vital energy to support him, the lightning strike would’ve just killed him.

Le Xiaobai who was standing next to the door jumped at least 2 meters backwards in fright, he shouted with a shock expression, “Go to hell! Those uncivilized ancient Inca men, how did they invent a high voltage electric net?!”

Wu Wang gripped the golden plate in his hand tightly, he stared at the huge door and shook his head, “Bullshit, high voltage electric net? If it really is that, then you would’ve been killed earlier!”

Wu Wang turned around and looked at Wu Qi with a worried expression, “Wu Qi, are you ok?”

Taking a deep breath, he carefully circulated the inner vital energy throughout his body one round. Wu Qi grinded his teeth and stood up. He shook his head and said, “I’m okay, but that lightning bolt consumed 70% of my inner vital energy.”

Gazing at the Dragon Abyss sword he was holding tightly, this sword truly deserve to be a famous ancient sword. After being hit by a lightning strike, there was no change in the sword itself. But, a mysterious blue color had appeared among the natural green color on the sword. The mysterious blue color closely resembled the electric lightning that appeared earlier.

Moving his body a little, Wu Qi grit his teeth and said, “Teacher, we’ll need to use that golden plate. This door, I’m afraid it’s just as weird as that living mummy.”

Wu Wang furrowed his brows. He held the golden plate tightly in his hands and started carefully moving closer to the door.

The golden plate was obtained by the disciples of the Underhand Sect a few months ago in a private museum in South America. With the Underhand Sect’s skillful judgment, this golden plate has a huge value no matter how you look at it, the material or the words carved on it, all valuable.

Therefore, this relic has arrived in the Underhand Sect smoothly. After being carefully studied by a few professionals with knowledge about the ancient history and language, they followed the clues on the golden place and finally arrived here.

The clues on the golden plate hadn’t fooled any of them. Let’s forget about everything else of value, just this huge door that can release lightning strikes and automatically attack has made all their efforts worth it. As for what’s behind the door, it only made the people here even more excited.

Carefully covering his right palm with vital energy and showing extreme caution, Wu Wang inserted the golden plate into a laughing sun symbol right in the middle of the door.

Just after the golden plate was inserted, the door suddenly started emitting a strong light. Wu Wang jumped backwards and kept a distance of at least 30 meters. The huge and heavy door quietly opened up by sliding both door panels to the side, presenting a huge space filled with bizarre lights.

Wu Wang gasped in astonishment and said, “We’ve struck rich this time!”

Wu Wang’s eyes kept widening as he blankly stared at the bizarre items inside that space.

Le Xiaobei extended his neck while mumbling to himself unconsciously, “Maglev? Deity? Immortal? Isn’t this going too far?”

Before he finished his words, three green light suddenly shot up from the ground behind them.

A few sounds were heard, the green light swept across everyone like a shining stretch of silk. Aside from Wu Wang, Wu Qi and Le Xiaobai, the rest of the Underhand Sect disciples were all dead now.

Dozens of blood pillars shot up into the air, dozens of human heads rolled on the floor.

Book 1, Chapter 3 – The Priest

Everything happened so suddenly, the three had yet to see exactly what the green light was, as the three green lights had already departed.

The heads that were severed by the green lights were still rolling in midair. Before the heads touched the ground, a bright light blinked from behind the passage, followed by a loud thunder bang that struck one’s ears. All three of them trembled, their clothes were torn apart by a huge force. The force pushed them down and made them roll into the huge stone room at the end of the passage, making them spit out blood along the way.

Wu Wang’s vision was sharp, he could barely see that what had just attacked them was a lightning bolt the size of an arm. The lightning bolt was both green and red, and about two to three meters long, but its power was equal to that of a small bomb. The three of them who were hit by the lightning, without any chance of resisting, they were sent rolling into the room.

Supporting himself with great effort as he stood up, Wu Wang shouted out fiercely and asked, “Who is that?!”

A chuck was heard from afar, then an appealing and silvery voice sounded out to them.

“All mortals envy the immortals, Green Lotus Root and Fiery Jujube is treated as food. The jade liquid nourishes the white tea, the success of the Water and Fire Pill shines upon the purple clouds.”

Following the reading of the Daoist poem, a young Dao priest wearing a purple robe walked in arrogantly. On both his chest and his back the eight trigrams stitched with silver lining, and a gorgeous pattern filled his robe. Behind this young Daoist priest was eight middle aged priests dressed in green who followed closely. Each of them had their eyes pointing towards the skies, portraying an unparalleled arrogance.

It was as if in their minds, Wu Wang, Le Xiaobai and Wu Qi were just some ants the could simply kill with a squeeze, they’re not really worth their attention.

Wu Qi focused his vision, he jumped up from where he laid and drew the Dragon Abyss sword out from its sheath, sending out a sword light and stabbing towards the heart of the priest in the purple robe.

“A rice sized pearl like you, still trying to shine!”

The purple robe priest had a scornful expression and a teasing smile. He casually pointed his finger, sending a bright white beam out from his sleeve. The white beam directly collided with the sword light that was unleashed with Wu Qi’s full strength. A crystal clear impact sounded out, the Dragon Abyss sword was blown into pieces. Wu Qi felt as if he had been struck by lightning. His body trembled and he was sent flying far away by the white beam, hitting the ground with his head so that he lost all ability to move.

Wu Qi immediately felt half his body becoming numb. The white beam was only about one meter long, but it was covered with an extreme cold. When the Dragon Abyss sword collided with the white beam, it was like hitting a huge mountain. The white beam didn’t suffer any damage, but Wu Qi almost broke all his bones.

His inner vital energy was shattered by the white beam. His body felt like had broken into several pieces. Wu Qi laid on the floor without even the ability to move his toe.

Shangguan Ye came into the room while leading a group of Underhand Sect disciples behind him with a villainous smile on his face. Looking at Shangguan Ye and his arms that were moving without any problems, it was obvious that the inner vital energy and cultivation base that was destroyed by Wu Qi had now fully recovered, and the nerves that were cut were now fully recovered as well.

Wu Qi was startled, he was the one who personally carried out the sentence on Shangguan Ye, so of course he knew how serious the wound he caused was. Shangguan Ye who was supposed to lay on a sickbed had now fully recovered. Impossibly enough, the wounds on his nerves had been cured as well.

Shangguan Ye fiercely gazed at Wu Qi, he pointed his finger at him while grinding his teeth and said, “Little bastard, I told you, you would all soon die!”

Few of Shangguan Ye’s trusted disciples walked over to Wu Qi’s side with evil smiles on their faces, they started kicking and punching Wu Qi.

Wu Qi who was now able to move again protected his head with his hands, he stretched himself and let these men attack him. Without anyone noticing, he had quietly taken out the Underhand Sect’s Sect Elder token from the secret pocket on his belt. He used the muscles on his waist, thigh and leg like water and quietly hid the Sect Elder token in his boot, at the bottom of his feet.

This was almost an instinct to him.

When Wu Qi saw Shangguan Ye started walking towards the stone chamber, he started this action. When Shangguan Ye’s trusted disciples started hitting him, he had managed to carefully hide the Sect Elder token inside his boot.

Sure enough, after Shangguan Ye shouted and scolded at Wu Qi, he immediately walked over to Wu Wang and started searching his body.

Wu Wang glared at the purple robed priest and said with a grin, “Shangguan Ye, are you blind?! Look, your father is only wearing boxers, why the fuck are you still touching me? What could I possibly hide on my body as I am now?!”

Shangguan Ye squeezed Wu Wang’s neck, he roared out loud asking, “Sect Elder token?! Where is the token?!”

Wu Wang laughed out loud, he shook his head and said, “Sect Elder token? I hid it in Swiss Bank’s safety vault!”

Shangguan Ye was obviously stunned by this. He stared at Wu Wang and shouted, “The Underhand Sect’s rules states that the Sect Elder token must be with the Sect Elder at all time! This is the rule set down by the founding grandmaster, why would you hide it in a safety vault?!”

Wu Wang rolled his eyes, he glared at Shangguan Ye while laughing, “Your father can do whatever he wants! Not happy then you can kiss my ass!”

The purple robed priest swung his sleeve, and a clear ‘slap!’ sound appeared, he had slapped Wu Wang’s face from afar. Blood spilled out from Wu Wang’s face, the purple robed priests slap had almost crushed Wu Wang’s cheek bone. A big chunk of flesh was ripped off, and fresh blood poured out.

“Unruly mortal, unbelievable!”

The purple robed priest stared at Wu Wang sideways, coldly teasing him, “You’re going to die, how dare you be so stubborn and arrogant?! Hmph!”

Wu Wang spat out some blood, he stared at the purple robed priest with a grin, “Sir, what immortal are you? Unruly mortal? Hehe, we’re all mortals here, what kind of superior being do you think you are?”

The purple robed priest showed a face that was too lazy to respond to Wu Wang. He turned his head towards Shangguan Ye and ordered him with a stiff expression, “Since they put so much effort into finding this Dimensional Portal, there’s no need to torture them too much. Just let them die in peace.”

Shangguan Ye answered in a respectful manner, he threw Wu Wang down onto the floor and forcefully stepped on his stomach, destroyed all inner vital energy Wu Wang had cultivated for many years. Then he pointed towards the purple robed priest and said with a sneer smile, “I’ll let you know this before you die, this is Little Priest Miao Yuan from the Green Mountain City, the last disciple of Elder Priest Zhiji Zi of the Green Mountain City!”

The purple robed priest put both his hands behind his back in a reserved manner, portraying a look of a man from another world. His eyes expressed extreme joy as he stared at the illogical item in the huge stone chamber beneath this mountain.

Wu Wang, Le Xiaobai and Wu Qi also looked at the illogical stuff in the chamber at the same time.

Right after the metal door was opened, the three of them discovered that the items in the chamber couldn’t be explained with common knowledge. From their experience and knowledge, they knew that they had discovered something really extraordinary.

Too bad things changed too fast. Shangguan Ye unexpectedly brought Priest Miao Yuan here, so Wu Qi and the rest didn’t have the time to study what exactly was in there, and now they were facing their doom. Faced with the miraculous abilities of Miao Yuan and the rest of the priests, they didn’t stand a chance at resisting.

It was unknown whether it was the nature or some human who made this. Underneath the mountain of Machu Picchu, someone excavated this sphere chamber that spanned almost a kilometer in diameter. This huge space stood on its own, its walls was smooth as mirrors, and it was hard to imagine that this sphere space was man-made. It is something that only technology that doesn’t yet exist could accomplish.

One the smooth and bright surface of the wall, hundreds of thousands thumb size pearls and gemstones were paved in. A variety of colors were shining brightly, forming a complicated star map on the wall of the mountain. When staring at this star map, as time goes by, the gem stones would shine brightly and make one feel as if this star map was quietly circulating. It was both amazing and unbelievable.

Under the colorful shine of the star map, an item that couldn’t be explained nor understood was floating in midair.

360 pieces of fine white tallow jade was floating on top of it, forming a sphere shaped formation with approximately 300 meters in diameter. These jades with the length of about 4 meters and a width of about 2 meters, and about 50 centimeters thick were carved with numerous complicated symbols. In between these symbols, thousands of shining fist sized objects filled the gaps.

These huge tallow jades were floating in midair without any movement, occasionally some arm sized streams of light would shoot out from these jades and zap into other nearby jades.

At the center of all these jade there was a round golden platform. On the platform, numerous symbols were carved in as well, 360 shining gem stones the size of a human head were inlaid on the platform itself. An ancient aura was being emitted from this golden platform. When everyone looked at this golden platform, it felt like they were watching ancient history itself in front of them.

Wu Qi who was being beaten suddenly started laughing out loud and said, “Teacher, we’ve found something incredible!”

Shangguan Ye walked towards him and forcefully stepped on his head. With a grin he said, “It is I, your father, who found this thing, it has nothing to do with you!”

Before he finished his words, Miao Yuan snorted coldly.

Shangguan Ye hurriedly altered his statement and said, “It is because of Priest Miao Yuan’s crafty plan that we were able to find this Dimensional Portal. All of you were nothing but chess pieces in the Priest’s hands, he used you all as if you were just mere tools! You even helped the Priest clear all those traps before this door!”

Bowing and smiling as he tried to flatter Miao Yuan, Shangguan Ye said, “All of this was planned by the Priest! Now you can all die here in peace.”

After listening to Shangguan Ye’s flatter, Miao Yuan showed a small smile. He shook his head proudly and said, “They are just some mortals. Being calculative with them is not needed with my status and dignity. Shangguan Ye, just let them be ghosts who can understand it all!”

Only after another round flattering, Shangguan Ye started proudly explaining the reason for everything that had happened to Wu Wang, Le Xiaobai and Wu Qi.

In faction, before Shangguan Ye joined the Underhand Sect, he had always leaned towards Miao Yuan, he had become his henchman long ago. Previously when Shangguan Ye had continuously stolen dozens of rich families’ treasures and heirloom, he had actually been following Miao Yuan’s orders. Those rich families would never dream that their heirlooms, to a cultivator like Miao Yuan, were considered rare treasures.

That’s right, Miao Yuan is a legendary cultivator, one of the cultivators who are chasing immortality, aiming to break through this realm and become an immortal.

Shangguan Ye was fighting for the Sect Elder position with Wu Wang but failed miserably, after that he immediately activated the communication crane talisman that Miao Yuan had given him, then he requested help from Miao Yuan. He was given a great miraculous pill and recovered his cultivation, also curing his nerves.

After kicking Wu Wang forcefully a few time, Shangguan Ye said with a grin, “If it wasn’t for the priest’s mercy after discovering that the golden plate in your hand held the clue that he was searching for, who would have let you come to Machu Picchu? Your dog head would already have been severed several months ago by a flying sword if he didn’t show mercy!”

Miao Yuan was also searching for a clue on the golden plate?

Le Xiaobai who was being held hostage by some of Shangguan Ye’s trusted disciples turned his head with great difficulty and glanced at the huge metal door.

Shangguan Ye gazed at Le Xiaobai, suddenly he started laughing and walking towards him, he fiercely punched Le Xiaobai in his stomach.

Le Xiaobai opened his mouth and spat out some blood mixed with small pieces of his internal organs. His body was incredibly weak, there was no way he could resist Shangguan Ye’s fierce punch. This punch had taken away half of Le Xiaobai’s life.

Glaring at Shangguan Ye who was releasing his anger on Wu Wang and the rest, Miao Yuan after some time said, “Alright, Shangguan Ye. You’ll be the Sect Elder of the Underhand Sect after this.”

Laughing in satisfaction, Miao Yuan spoke once again, “Teacher sent all the disciples of our sect out to search for this Dimensional Portal, but I’m the one who found it first! Not only did I find the clue, I also witnessed the Dimensional Portal itself!”

An emotional sigh left Miao Yuan’s mouth, closed his eyes with a smile on his face, “The Green City Chief position is now in my hands!”

Pointing at Wu Wang and the other two, Miao Yuan said in a cold manner, “Just nice, the ‘Grand Heavenly Circulation Positioning Talisman’ requires the portal to be activated before it can provide a destination. Wouldn’t it just be boring if the portal isn’t activated?”

While instructing Shangguan Ye to place Wu Wang and the other two men onto the huge golden platform right in the middle of the portal, Miao Yuan started laughing out loud.

“Being able to die in this miraculous ancient portal, being killed by the nature’s scary forces… nobodies like you should all be considered lucky!”

Still laughing, Miao Yuan shot a golden beam out from his sleeve, hitting the golden platform.

Chapter 1: Let Me Level Up

“Ow, by the gods, it hurts Senior Apprentice-Brother, harder, I’m almost done for.” On the training ground of the Holy Demon Sect, a youth who looked to be just 16, 17 years of age was standing there right now screaming in pain, but looking at his face of pain it revealed a trace of pleasure.

Lin Fan had a big secret, that was that he wasn’t a native of this place and instead came from Earth. It wasn’t just his soul that crossed-over but his body that also crossed-over with him.

When he first came to this mysterious world Lin Fan was ecstatic in his heart. Ever read novels? Which one of those main characters in the books weren’t super amazing, strength, status, wealth, beauties, those were all at the tip of their fingers.

With a shake of the body and releasing his bastard aura, who cared if you were the sovereign of a sect or a peerless beauty, they’d all have to obediently bow before his feet.

But right when Lin Fan’s daydream hadn’t reached the end yet, he fucking discovered that there was something wrong. He was actually the fucking sandbag in a dark sect for disciples to train. At the time when he learned this news, Lin Feng was stupefied on the spot.

Even if I was a fucking piece of trash I could tolerate it, at least no matter what I’d be the trash young master of some big clan.

But now he was a punching bag for people to train, this instantly made Lin Fan not want to say anything more and he even secretly cried in grief for a number of days.

In the first year of time arriving at this Holy Demon Sect, the pain that Lin Fan who was still stupefied experienced was also inhuman. He was even nearly beaten into a third rate good-for-nothing.

If it wasn’t that this Holy Demon Sect still had a bit of a conscience and gave the sandbags a body training manual, he probably would have already died.

《Titanium Demon Body》

When he first got this body training manual Lin Fan’s heart was filled with joy. Look at this name, such swag and dominance, if he learned this how could he not be invincible?

But only after Lin Fan himself started feeling around and practising it did he discover that this thing was fucking complete bullshit.

《Titanium Demon Body》had a total of three levels, it was a body training technique that the Holy Demon Sect’s founder casually wrote, the sandbags’ exclusive technique.

Even if it was trained to the third level, based on what’s said in the manual, achieving the Titanium Demon Body was nothing but scrap that those disciples could cut down with one swing with their weapons.

But luckily God would not disappoint those who persevered. Even God couldn’t bear to watch Lin Fan’s tragic fate and during a dark windy night, after Lin Fan had explored life with Father Sleep’s daughter in his dream, he discovered that he suddenly had a data based system.

Lin Fan studied it for a long while and didn’t find any sort of artificial intelligence mentioned in novels, he had to figure things out completely by himself.

As for this data based system, Lin Fan didn’t really understand it at the start, but afterwards he noticed that under the character data page there was the data of the《Titanium Demon Body》that he practised.

Originally after completing his daily sandbag work Lin Fan would immediately go back without any stop to eat and train. After all if he didn’t successfully cultivate the《Titanium Demon Body》, god knows when he’d be killed by someone with a heavy hit.

But now Lin Fan just waited everyday for these disciples to beat him and then went back to sleep, having that beautiful daydream of his.

After despicably yelling at that disciple who was red in the face, Lin Fan opened his character page and started taking a close look. A bit more work and the 《Titanium Demon Body》was about to advance to LV5.

As for this《Titanium Demon Body》manual saying that the peak was LV3, but he was already about to reach Lv5, what was going on?

Name: Lin Fan

Level: 1

EXP: 0

Skills:《Titanium Demon Body》LV4 (2000/3000)

…….

Looking at his own character page, Lin Feng also felt that it was a bit shabby. For a long time now his level had always been LV1. As for leveling up, it wasn’t like Lin Fan hadn’t thought of it before, but he’d never been able to find a way.

It had already been one year since arriving at this world, even though he’d never left the Holy Demon Sect before Lin Fan had still inquired about the cultivation levels of this world.

Mortal, Primordial, Divinity, Lesser Celestial, Greater Celestial….

Every stage was split into 9 levels.

Lin Fan knew that there was most likely more than these, but who told him to just be a sandbag. Being able to investigate this much was already pretty good.

“+1”

“+1”

“+1”

……..

The experience for the 《Titanium Demon Body》 slowly rose. Looking at the sect disciple before him who was already using all of his strength, Lin Fan sighed. He really was unlucky today, actually encountering such a noob disciple. Every attack could only increase 1 point of experience.

Moreover his fists were weak and powerless when hitting the body, Lin Fan was even thinking that it’d better not stop giving experience…

Sure enough, your worst fears always come true.

“+0”

“+0”

…….

Holy shit, this good-for-nothing really can’t go on anymore. He doesn’t even add experience anymore, screw this.

Lin Fan turned his head over looking at his fellow Sandbag Party comrades in the surrounding. Right now they were screaming incessantly as though they’d suffered the greatest pain in their lives.

In the Holy Demon Sect, nobody would care if the sandbags were beat to death by the disciples, they would just directly dig a hole to bury them and that was that.

“Why aren’t you screaming.” At the moment, seeing Lin Fan who was screaming incessantly before now looking around everywhere, a trace of anger immediately rose up in that disciple’s heart. When the sandbag was wailing constantly from being beaten by him, even though he was a bit tired he was also very excited and he felt that he was very amazing.

But now he was angry.

Thinking that he couldn’t waste this entire day, Lin Fan stared at the sect disciple in front of him. “Scream your mom, acting is very tiring okay? Your fists are weak and powerless like a girl’s.”

Upon hearing these words of humiliation that sect disciple’s face instantly turned red and blue, his gaze also became very furious.

Looking at the expression of this sect disciple Lin Fan laughed out loud, “Your facial expressions aren’t bad, go back and drink some more milk, it’s like you’re tickling me.”

“You… You.” This sect disciple was suddenly as though he couldn’t speak. His voice also became choked with sobs and that gaze that was originally still very aggressive suddenly changed, becoming teary.

“Wahh…. You’re bullying me, my fists aren’t weak and powerless.”

Right now Lin Fan was instantly stunned. Looking at that crying disciple who ran out of the training ground crying and his bare asscrack, Lin Fan was speechless. (TL: I have absolutely no clue… The disciple could potentially be a child wearing a sort of children’s pants where there is a hole in the backside. Apparently ‘tis a thing in China.)

As a disciple of a dark sect, how can he be so brittle.

Lin Fan shook his head and didn’t pay any more attention to this guy. Instead he had to think of a way to hurriedly increase his level.

Just LV4 of the《Titanium Demon Body》was already a bit ridiculous, wonder what LV5 would be like.

Lin Fan held his chin standing on the spot. Looking at those sect disciples furiously beating the sandbags, the corner of his lips instantly revealed a smile.

It looked like he needed to activate taunting mode.

Lin Fan gathered his breath and then roared out loud.

“Everybody stop, I have something to say…”

Lin Fan’s roar was entirely able to compete with the Lion’s Roar in novels. In Lin Fan’s opinion wasn’t it just seeing who had the loudest voice? (TL: Lion’s Roar is a very common technique in wuxia novels usually attributed to buddhist martial arts or is something everyone knows.)

Back in the day I was the exercise leader of the class, I had to have a loud voice.

Those sect disciples using the sandbags to train were all stopped by this roar.

Those sandbags that were screaming in pain looked at Lin Fan with their badly beaten faces, not knowing what this sandbag who was in the same group as them wanted to do?

Some sandbags quickly caught their breath at this moment, awaiting the next wave of attacks.

When would these kinds of days reach an end.

Supposedly if they were to train the《Titanium Demon Body》to the third level then they would be able to become disciples for the outer sect examination, the same as these outer sect examination disciples who treated them like sandbags.

But just thinking about it they felt that it was impossible. Some senior sandbags who had persevered here for a couple years had only just barely trained the 《Titanium Demon Body》 to the first level.

As for how hard the third level was, it was nearly impossible.

And at this time, when those sandbags who were still catching their breath heard Lin Fan’s following sentence, they were all dumbfounded.

“You guys don’t need to look at me with a puzzled expression. With all due respect, in my eyes everybody here is garbage…” Lin Fan held one hand behind his back, taunting those outer sect examination disciples with his finger in contempt.

TSS Chapter 2: Come Hit Me You Trash
Posted on January 29, 2017 by sylver135
I tried putting the inner thoughts of the MC in italics per a previous suggestion. Might or might not continue doing this.

“What did he say?”

“Garbage, he actually dared to say we’re all garbage.”

“Damnit, we are the outer sect examination disciples of the Holy Demon Sect. As long as we pass the examination we’ll be able to become disciples of the outer sect. This mere sandbag dares to speak to us like so, detestable.”

“Which one of us isn’t a dragon amongst the people and a descendant of nobility. This mere sandbag actually dares to humiliate us like so. Calm down apprentice-brothers, allow me to teach a good lesson to this ignorant fool.”

Right now this group of outer sect examination disciples were completely angered. They didn’t think that one of the lowliest people in the sect actually dared to talk against them, he was practically seeking death.

And right now after hearing this person’s words that attracted so much hatred, those sandbags also all shed tears of gratitude in their heart.

“Big Bro…”

“Boss…”

“Dad…”

……

Lin Fan stood there, watching that person who walked towards him, “Kid, you’re too presumptuous. Even though I won’t take your pathetic life, I’ll have you understand that being arrogant is not right.”

Even though these outer sect examination disciples hadn’t learned the martial arts of the Holy Demon Sect, to the average person their own strength was impressive. Even though it wasn’t at the level of cracking metal and splitting stone, they could still smash apart a tree the thickness of a bowl.

“Ah…” This outer sect disciple prepared to teach Lin Fan a good lesson let out an angry shout, his legs took stance and he attacked with full force.

“Bam…”

Lin Fan looked at this person in front of him, the corner of his lips revealed a slight smile.

“+2”

This guy really is a bit better than the guy from before, not bad, not bad.

“Well well, and you guys didn’t believe me when I called you guy’s trash. Soft and weak, can you try harder.” Lin Fan stood there, brushing his chest in contempt.

“Again…”

“Kid, don’t be too arrogant, atatatata….” Right now this outer sect examination disciple refused to believe his attacks didn’t work.

“+2”

“+2”

……

At this moment, this outer sect examination disciple’s hands were shaking. He breathed heavily and sweat was also falling drop by drop from his forehead.

“What’s wrong, can’t go on?” Lin Fan smiled looking at this guy in front of him. Not bad, not bad, gave over 100 points of experience, even though his attacks at the end were weak and powerless and didn’t add much experience, the attacks at the front were still okay.

Right now this outer sect examination disciple lifted his head looking at Lin Fan, there was some disbelief in his eyes. Is this guy made of fucking steel.

“You…” Seeing this guy before him being so arrogant, this outer sect examination disciple was overwhelmed with indignation, but he couldn’t do anything. Afterwards he roared out loud, “Apprentice-brothers, kill him…”

Lin Fan was waiting precisely for this moment, LV5 of the 《Titanium Demon Body》 had to depend on the help of these guys. Wonder exactly how many levels this 《Titanium Demon Body》 has, right now there’s already no feeling when these outer sect examination disciple’s hit me, if I were to madly level up this 《Titanium Demon Body》 to LV100 then wouldn’t I be invincible.

“Haha, come on you trash, use all of your strength.” Lin Fan laughed out loud, immediately countless fists rained down on Lin Fan’s body.

“Kid, don’t be too insolent.”

“Today we’ll have you know our power.”

…….

“+2”

“+1”

“+1”

“+0”

……..

At this time, seeing a guy who didn’t even give any more freaking experience when punching him still taking up a spot like he was actually doing something, it instantly made Lin Fan displeased.

This guy was entirely taking up the latrine but not taking a shit, afterwards Lin Fan kicked him aside while he was caught off guard and made room for other people.

Looking at the experience of the 《Titanium Demon Body》 constantly soaring up, Lin Fan’s heart was very ecstatic. Sure enough, with more people the experience also rose faster.

Seeing Lin Fan being beaten by a group of people, those sandbags in the surrounding slumped down on the ground were also extremely grateful in their heart.

“Big Bro, go in peace, we’ll definitely regularly think of you after you die.”

“Sob Sob… How come I feel like crying so much from watching, from now on you’re our Big Bro.”

……

Right now the outer sect examination disciples were vigorously beating Lin Fan, every punch was full of strength.

“Kid, who told you to be arrogant, today we’ll beat you until you beg on your knees.”

“Hmph, dare to talk against us, if we don’t teach you a good lesson today you really won’t know the immensity of heaven and earth.”

……

Right now to absorb force even better, Lin Fan lied down directly on the ground with his face facing down. Based on Lin Fan’s justification, regardless of toes or fingers, as long as he received a strong enough attack it would all be able to increase experience.

Soon… Soon.

2850/3000.

There’s still 150 points of experience, please don’t fail me.

In regards to after advancing to LV5, wonder if the attack of these guys can still add experience for the 《Titanium Demon Body》.

Originally at LV1, these outer sect examination disciples could all give me 10 points of experience with every hit. With the increase of the level, the experience also became smaller and smaller. After reaching LV4 it was just straight up increasing by 1-2 points, sometimes there was even no fucking experience. Looks like after this level rises up I’ll have to change methods.

“Holy shit… Who kicked my asshole…”

“Hey, don’t go too far or else I’ll turn on you.”

Fuck…”

“Ding… 《Titanium Demon Body》levelled up to LV5.”

“Ding, satisfied activation condition for The Strongest Upgrade System, entering adjustment mode, will fall unconscious for 24 hours.”

“5.”

“4.”

…….

“1.”

“Entering unconscious state, The Strongest Upgrade System conducting full activation mode.”

…….

At this moment Lin Fan was completely unconscious, Lin Fan was really looking forward to The Strongest Upgrade System’s features after fully activating.

Right now on the scene, the outer sect examination disciples were already dead tired. They were very angry at this sandbag who dared to provoke them, presumably he was probably already dead by now.

“Everybody stop, I think this guy’s dead.”

At this time a relatively muscular outer sect examination disciple shouted red-faced with sweat dripping down from his forehead.

“Huh, he’s not moving, I think he really is dead.”

“Even a bull probably wouldn’t be able to stand all of this.”

Right now a disciple went forward feeling for Lin Fan’s breath at his nose and immediately exclaimed, “Huh, he’s still breathing, he’s not dead.”

“Is this guy a monster, not even dead like this.”

“Hmph, it’s getting late, three days later is the outer sect examination. We still need train properly and go all out.”

“Let’s go…”

……..

When these outer sect examination disciples left the training ground, those sandbags who were hiding far away the whole time hurriedly walked over.

“Hurry up and carry Big Bro back to heal.”

“Big Bro is a true man, I Dog Balls the 2nd have never admired anyone in my life, only this Big Bro of mine.”

“What can these outer sect examination disciple’s do, they still have to attack in a group to be able to defeat Big Bro.”

“Big Bro has definitely trained the 《Titanium Demon Body》 to the third level, those prodigies of the outer sect are nothing more than so.”

“Cut the crap, hurry up and take Big Bro back.”

“Right, you’ve got to hold on Big Bro…”

TSS Chapter 3: The Most Terrifying Martial Art In The World
Posted on February 1, 2017 by sylver135
I wanted to say something, but just like how this thought quietly came, it also quietly left. I hate this feeling… Obligatory complain about grammar.

 

Lin Fan opened his eyes and his facial expression instantly changed. For anybody, seeing a couple of pancake faces appearing in their vision the moment they opened their eyes was a devastating thing.

“What are you guys doing?” Lin Fan’s voice was shaking. Did these guys do some inhuman things to me while I was unconscious?

Such as…..

“Big Bro, you’re finally awake. I knew you weren’t such an easily defeated person.” One of the boys by Lin Fan’s side said with an excited look.

“Um…”

Lin Fan was stunned. What do these guys mean, when did I become their big bro. Oh right, the system is officially activated, I’ve got to study it. He immediately stopped paying attention to these guys and directly started checking it out.

Name: Lin Fan

Level: 1

EXP: (0/10)

Skills: 《Titanium Demon Body》 LV5 (3,000/10,000)

Explore everything else yourself.

There wasn’t much of a difference from before, but a change occurred over at the experience.

“Big Bro is definitely hungry, hurry up and get food for Big Bro.”

“Right, right…”

Not long after, a big bowl of savoury chicken soup was brought up. Lin Fan didn’t say anything, his stomach was already protesting in starvation. Under numerous envious gazes Lin Fan wiped out this big bowl of chicken soup.

To think that even though we’re all sandbags, they actually still had this kind of good stuff hidden, not bad, not bad.

“Big Bro’s definitely tired after eating, let Big Bro have a good rest. You’ve got to hang on Big Bro.”

“Big Bro will definitely be an extraordinary person in the future.”

“It’s just a shame that Dog Balls the 2nd was unfortunately beat to death this morning and won’t have the chance to see Big Bro’s prestige in the future. (TL: A moment of silence for Dog Balls the 2nd.)

……

As a dark sect, life and death were common in the Holy Demon Sect. Everyday there were sandbags who died, they were used to this sort of thing.

After everybody left, there was one person who stayed behind.

He was of short stature, not quite bulky and his looks were a bit of a disappointment to the people. He could be considered a person of ability for being able to survive in the Sandbag Party.

“Big Bro, this is the technique passed down in my family. I think the one who is able obtains it, Big Bro is a prodigy from amongst us, you have to continue going strong.” This person took a blue covered secret manual that had become tattered from the passage of time and handed it over to Lin Fan.

Lin Fan didn’t hesitate and took it over. Afterwards he looked at this person in front of him, “Okay, in the future if you don’t die and I am able to become a figure who dominates the world, I will guarantee you great success.”

This was Lin Fan’s first time making a promise to someone since arriving in this world.

“Um…”

“Big Bro, don’t be like this, I… Just… Just hope that you’ll work hard.”  Quite obviously this person didn’t take to heart Lin Fan’s promise, and even in his opinion he thought this big bro was bluffing a bit too hard.

Lin Fan didn’t saying anything, he knew that this person clearly didn’t believe in him.

Giving charcoal in the snowy winter beats adding flowers on the embroidery. At present he was just at the start, Lin Fan would remember everybody who helped him. Lin Fan silently remembered in his heart the appearance of this person before him, in the future he would definitely return him a big gift.

“Big Bro, you have a good rest then, I’m going back now.”

“Okay.” Lin Fan nodded his head and then started reading the manual.

“Ding, do you want to learn trivial manual 《Monkey Steals the Peach》?”

Of course I’m learning it, no matter how small a mosquito is it’s still meat.

Especially in this world, even though Lin Fan wasn’t an elite of the sect, he still knew that the sect kept a close watch over their techniques. As for being able to enter the Library to choose a technique after becoming an outer sect disciple or whatnot, that was utter bullshit.

For a sect, there were at least tens of thousands and as many as hundreds of thousands of outer sect disciples. Where were there so many techniques for people to choose.

People, still have to rely on themselves.

“Ding, learned 《Monkey Steals the Peach》.”

“LV1 (0/10)”

This again, this 《Monkey Steals the Peach》 clearly only has two levels, wonder how many levels I can upgrade this to.

Even though this 《Monkey Steals the Peach》 was only a trivial technique, Lin Fan believed that even if it was garbage, he could still upgrade it to a supreme technique.

《Monkey Steals the Peach》 only had one move. For a man this one move had devastating power, crushing your balls with one move.

Lin Fan inhaled a deep breath and his body instantly moved. His right hand opened forming a claw and grabbed towards that indescribably wonderful place as though driving straight to the enemy’s den.

“+2”

“+2”

……

“Ding, trivial technique 《Monkey Steals the Peach》 upgraded to LV2, character EXP+10.”

“Ding, character leveled up.”

Haha… Lin Fan laughed out loud. To think that in not even a minute 《Monkey Steals the Peach》 was upgraded to LV2, looks like I really am a peerless prodigy.

As long as I upgrade 《Monkey Steals the Peach》 to LV100,  I’ll be able crush even God’s balls.

Name: Lin Fan

Level: 2

EXP: (0/20)

Skills: 《Titanium Demon Body》 LV5 (3000/10,000)

             《Monkey Steals the Peach》 LV2 (10/50)

…….

Lin Fan stood up and hurriedly rushed towards the training ground. How could he waste his precious time like so, he had to make good use of it.

And seeing their Big Bro leaving in a rush, those sandbags living in the surrounding were also extremely puzzled in their heart.

“What’s Big Bro going to do?”

“Isn’t Big Bro heavily injured? How come I see that his steps are vigorous and full of energy, could he be okay?”

“Oh no, not good, Big Bro suffered big time for us yesterday. It must be just now when I said Dog Balls the 2nd was beat to death by those outer sect examination disciples, he’s thinking of going to get revenge.”

“A person who values comradeship as much as Big Bro will definitely create trouble. No, we have to follow over.”

…..

Not long later, Lin Fan arrived at the buzzing training ground.

Watching those outer sect examination disciples training hard, Lin Fan was also delighted in his heart. This was all freaking experience.

《Titanium Demon body》 has already reached LV5, wonder how much experience these guys can still give me.

Just thinking about it Lin Fan was a bit unable to hold back.

“Everybody stop.” Right now Lin Fan roared out loud like yesterday.

This roar was even louder than yesterday.

When the outer sect examination disciples on the training ground saw the owner of the voice, they were all stunned and then started to talk amongst themselves.

“This guy again.”

“This guy was beat half to death by us yesterday, how come he’s full of energy again today.”

“Hmph, after yesterday’s lesson I bet he won’t dare to be impudent.”

……

The moment this outer sect examination disciple finished speaking, Lin Fan placed his hand at his hip and yelled loudly with his finger extended forward as though guiding the country.

“Everybody… With all due respect…”

But this time before Lin Fan had even finished speaking, those outer sect examination disciples instantly went into a riot.

“Apprentice-brothers, this guy is once again provoking us and using words to humiliate us, we must make him pay.”

……

Lin Fan smiled staring at the outer sect examination disciples who charged over and revealed a pleased smile.

“Smart kids, after yesterday’s matter you guys can already make ties to yesterday, not bad, not bad.”

“Then let’s see how much experience you guys can still give 《Titanium Demon Body》, I just hope it isn’t too little…”

Lin Fan looked with hope at this group of outstanding youths….

“+0”

“+0”

……

At this moment Lin Fan who was originally full of expectation abruptly changed his expression.

Fuck me…

This… This.

“Kid, today we’ll have you know what a tragic fate is.”

“Forgetful dunce, do you really think we’re to be trifled with.”

“I am the son of Prince Zhennan, my Art of Purgatory has already reached perfection. I’ll have you feel the torture of living hell.”

Lin Fan stared at this group of furious outer sect examination disciples. If it was like yesterday maybe he would have been very excited, because the harder they worked the more he benefited.

But now…

“You little bastards, since you guys are so useless I’ll have you guys experience the most terrifying martial art in the world, pain that you guys will be unable to forget for eternity…”

“Monkey Steals the Peach….”
